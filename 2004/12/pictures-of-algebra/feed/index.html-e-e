					<description><![CDATA[Wow, I&#039;ve never seen this kind of thing shown anywhere. I was lucky enough to have an algebra teacher growing up who used stuff like this, and I think it really influenced my teaching style. I tutor a lot of people in math from middle school students to non-traditional students who have went back to school after working for a decade or two, and no matter the topic, I always try to come up with visuals like this that help to build on a student&#039;s existing intuition. Thanks for showing me this, now I have more ideas to bounce around. :)]]></description>
