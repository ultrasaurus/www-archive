					<description><![CDATA[Of course it is a better tool! And, as with tools, we are only left with what we have, but with a larger audience.
I suppose that&#039;s why I love blogging.

					<description><![CDATA[You said: &quot;Writing English is not like writing code. It&#039;s harder (at least for me). There&#039;s no compiler. You can&#039;t run it afterwards to see if makes sense and feels right.&quot;

True there&#039;s no compiler or acceptance test.  But you can ask for peer review from fellow writers.  I have a group writer friends scattered across the country.  We review and comment on each others work, offer suggestions, and help each other get unstuck.  My writer community helps me asnwer the quesions about does it make sense and feel right. (They also tell me when I should just start over.)
