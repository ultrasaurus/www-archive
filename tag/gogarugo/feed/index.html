										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.igvita.com/">Ilya Grigorik</a>, gave a very informative talk &#8220;Ruby Proxies for Scale, Performance, and Monitoring&#8221;</p>
<p>Ilya describes a proxy server as his new favorite hammer.  I can think of lots of cases where having an easy way to write a proxy server would come in handy.  Mostly what we think of when we think of proxy servers is a &#8220;transparent, cut-through proxy,&#8221; but proxies can be useful for other purposes.</p>
<p>The problem that led Ilya to write a proxy server was benchmarking and performance testing.  He started with HTTPPerf is good tool for simulating load, but it is only good for a single run. <a href="http://github.com/igrigorik/autoperf/">autoperf</a> will make multiple runs and simulate more users.  </p>
<p><a href="http://github.com/igrigorik/em-proxy/">em-proxy</a> Very simple syntax to send traffic to both the production server and benchmark server (and only the response is returned from production).  Real-time benchmarking against production traffic and user sees no performance hit. Only about 300 lines of code, shows the pattern for how to build a proxy server. </p>
<p>Ilya walked us through using <a href="http://rubyeventmachine.com/">EventMachine</a> which has very concise, easy-to-read syntax for implementing proxy servers.  This does not need to be restricted to http, but can work with any protocol.</p>
<p>Ilya described an interesting use case in detail. They created a proxy server which works with Beanstalkd, a distributed in-member work queue, where jobs are stored in MySql when they don&#8217;t need to be in memory.  </p>
