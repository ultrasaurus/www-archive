					<description><![CDATA[Thank you very much for taking the time to discuss what the actual work and environment of a Presidential Innovation Fellow is like. The projects sound amazing, but your exposition goes a long way to translate these large projects into elements small enough to imagine taking on and working.

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m excited that I submitted my application. What I found most reassuring about what you wrote was that it sounds like a team/family effort that required a variety of different skill sets. I also liked that you were also inspired personally on this journey through another colleague. After reading this I&#039;m totally stoked to see what happens next. Thank you for taking the time to share your experience!
