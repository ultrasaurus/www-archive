					<description><![CDATA[Gee.. you think perhaps the standard of females and math might have something to do with an unbiased education system? What a rubbish article, as if women have &#039;evolved&#039; to become better at Math. No it&#039;s more likely our schools social structure now allows women to learn the same subjects as men. My parents generation had women doing sewing and cooking while men did woodwork and Math. Ridiculous.
Now it&#039;s a matter of getting the rest of our society up to speed.
