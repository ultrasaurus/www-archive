					<description><![CDATA[Of course there&#039;s no substitute for preparation. And always do a run through with the demo equipment once before the talk in its final configuration (I&#039;m always amazed at the number of people who expect it to &quot;just work&quot;).

But what I find very useful is, once the talk has started, to &quot;sink into the moment.&quot; Rather than trying to get through it quickly, which is the natural tendency, pause for a moment at the beginning, slow way down, and tell yourself this is all there is, where you are right now, what you&#039;re doing right now. I get the same feeling when I do Tai Chi (if I&#039;m doing it right).
