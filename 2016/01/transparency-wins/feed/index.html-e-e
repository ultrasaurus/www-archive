					<description><![CDATA[Sarah, I&#039;s so glad you wrote this up. I love that talk and the spirit of what it means for the creative process. Transparency in the process of creating things opens up so many opportunities for critique, reflection, learning... To me long term, it&#039;s about aspiring to do the greatest possible work, for the greatest good, rather than short term incremental advantage.

The transparency process you talk about reminds me a bit of the ideas of Gracious Professionalism and Coopertition espoused by the FIRST foundation. Great inspiration for future business leaders. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Inspiration_and_Recognition_of_Science_and_Technology
