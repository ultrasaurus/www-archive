When my kid was little, there was a dramatic shift in which games were fun and what was interesting to talk about.  I had to reset my expectations regularly and be open to learning who he was and how he wanted me to interact with him.  Most of the time, it didn&#8217;t actually seem to me that he was really changing, so much as simply becoming more of who he was.<\/p>\n<p>I came to realize that this technique of being open to learning who someone is, even when, especially when, you have known them for a long time, is pretty effective with adults too.  We meet someone and we know them for a few years and we think we really know them, but we only know one moment, one slice of their lives.<\/p>\n<p>Most people who meet me think I&#8217;m naturally outgoing and that it is easy for me to talk to new people.  In reality, people scare me.  Half the time I have no idea what might be a good thing to say and afterwards I&#8217;m sure the things I said were terribly stupid, annoying or simply boring. However, I&#8217;ve come to believe that this interaction between us humans isn&#8217;t actually about me or even about you, it&#8217;s about creating some new, interesting thing in the space between us.  It&#8217;s a service to put something out there.  It&#8217;s selfish not to.  It&#8217;s fleeting in reality, so as much as it feels like I&#8217;m vulnerable, it&#8217;s actually pretty low risk.<\/p>\n<p>I practice being open to who someone is right now.  What will I discover that is different right now from my preconceptions based on this other person I&#8217;ve known for a week or a month or a year.  And when I&#8217;m lucky and good, I learn something new, and sometimes I get to be that person who isn&#8217;t the same person I was last year, or who you thought I was.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As a mom, I have found I need to get to know my kid anew every year.
