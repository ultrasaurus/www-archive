Setup took two tries, apparently it doesn&#8217;t work on 5G wifi (<a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/kalvin\">Kalvin<\/a> found via Google search) and then we all delighted in flailing around with swipe and tap gestures to figure out how to use the thing.  I took a photo of <a href=\"twitter.com\/judytuna\">Judy<\/a> trying to get it to play a video&#8230; not quite the streamlined experience we&#8217;ve been led to expect, but that&#8217;s ok.  We&#8217;re explorers. It&#8217;s fun. <\/p>\n<p>She made <a href=\"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/106689835670274491358\/posts\/aUWg5YAafke\" target=\"_blank\">this first person chinese ribbons video<\/a>  and I recorded <a href=\"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/106689835670274491358\/posts\/4EaaLXWKKgs\" target=\"_blank\">this video of the same chinese ribbons<\/a> from a 3rd person perspective.  Then I shared them to Google+, sadly I can embed them in my blog.<\/p>\n<p>Then I accidentally started a hangout with EVERYONE in all of my google circles.  Luckily I don&#8217;t really use Google+ that much, so I *only* invited 82 people to my hangout!  Most of my friends and acquaintances were fairly entertained.<\/p>\n<p>I have all sorts of ideas for apps, mostly silly and fun, some serious.
