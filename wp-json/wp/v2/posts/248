I believe that storytelling is a powerful element of great software design, and probably game design as well (although I&#8217;m no game designer).  Despite his contrarian argument, I enjoyed reading his talk.  Here are some highlights:<\/p>\n<p><font size=\"+1\">&#8220;Don&#8217;t become a well-rounded person. Well rounded people are smooth and dull. Become a thoroughly spiky person. Grow spikes from every angle. Stick in their throats like a pufferfish.&#8221;<\/font><\/p>\n<p>He paraphrases what he calls  the the classic doctrine of Humanist SF as it applies to computer game design:<br \/>\n<em><br \/>\n&#8220;Movies and plays get much of their power from the resonances<br \/>\nbetween the structural layers. The congruence between the theme,<br \/>\nplot, setting and character layouts generates emotional power.<br \/>\nComputer games will never have a significant theme level because<br \/>\nthe outcome is variable. The lack of theme alone will limit the<br \/>\nstorytelling power of computer games.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Hard to refute. Impossible to refute. Ladies and gentlemen to<br \/>\nhell with the marvellous power of storytelling. If the audience<br \/>\nfor science fiction wanted *storytelling*, they wouldn&#8217;t read<br \/>\ngoddamned *science fiction,* they&#8217;d read Harpers and Redbook and<br \/>\nArgosy. The pulp magazine (which is our genre&#8217;s primary example<br \/>\nof a dead platform) used to carry all kinds of storytelling.<br \/>\nWestern stories. Sailor stories. Prizefighting stories. G-8 and<br \/>\nhis battle aces. Spicy Garage Tales. Aryan Atrocity Adventures.<br \/>\nThese things are dead. Stories didn&#8217;t save them. Stories won&#8217;t<br \/>\nsave us. Stories won&#8217;t save *you.*<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is not the route to follow. We&#8217;re not into science fiction<br \/>\nbecause it&#8217;s *good literature,* we&#8217;re into it because it&#8217;s<br \/>\n*weird*. Follow your weird, ladies and gentlemen. Forget trying<br \/>\nto pass for normal. Follow your geekdom. Embrace your nerditude.<br \/>\nIn the immortal words of Lafcadio Hearn, a geek of incredible<br \/>\nobscurity whose work is still in print after a hundred years,<br \/>\n&#8220;woo the muse of the odd.&#8221; A good science fiction story is not a<br \/>\n&#8220;good story&#8221; with a polite whiff of rocket fuel in it. A good<br \/>\nscience fiction story is something that knows it is science<br \/>\nfiction and plunges through that and comes roaring out of the<br \/>\nother side. Computer entertainment should not be more like<br \/>\nmovies, it shouldn&#8217;t be more like books, it should be more like<br \/>\ncomputer entertainment, SO MUCH MORE LIKE COMPUTER ENTERTAINMENT<br \/>\nTHAT IT RIPS THROUGH THE LIMITS AND IS SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE TO<br \/>\nIGNORE!&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I just read Bruce Sterling.
