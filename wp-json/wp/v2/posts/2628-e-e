In response to a reader, he added a <a href=\"http:\/\/digiphile.wordpress.com\/2010\/04\/18\/why-including-women-matters-for-the-future-of-technology-and-society\/#comment-1025\">comment<\/a> which I find particularly insightful and compelling.\u00a0 He quotes a column by David Brooks last year on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/05\/01\/opinion\/01brooks.html\">genius<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>If you wanted to picture how a typical genius might  develop, you\u2019d take a girl who possessed a slightly above average verbal  ability. It wouldn\u2019t have to be a big talent, just enough so that she  might gain some sense of distinction. Then you would want her to meet,  say, a novelist, who coincidentally shared some similar biographical  traits. Maybe the writer was from the same town, had the same ethnic  background, or, shared the same birthday \u2014 anything to create a sense of  affinity.<\/p>\n<p>This contact would give the girl a vision of her future self. It  would, Coyle emphasizes, give her a glimpse of an enchanted circle she  might someday join. It would also help if one of her parents died when  she was 12, infusing her with a profound sense of insecurity and fueling  a desperate need for success.<\/p>\n<p>Armed with this ambition, she would read novels and literary  biographies without end. This would give her a core knowledge of her  field. She\u2019d be able to chunk Victorian novelists into one group,  Magical Realists in another group and Renaissance poets into another.  This ability to place information into patterns, or chunks, vastly  improves memory skills. She\u2019d be able to see new writing in deeper ways  and quickly perceive its inner workings.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Then Alexander Howard adds:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Replace \u201cwriting\u201d with \u201ccoding\u201d and \u201cnovelist\u201d with \u201cdeveloper\u201d and  perhaps you might see my thinking on the importance of mentorship,  networks and modeling.<\/p>\n<p>In as far as the problems that exist in this area, I\u2019m not sure  they\u2019re entirely created during childhood, nor that their remediation  lies only in education in classrooms, libraries and laboratories.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>There are two points here which are key to solving the problem.\u00a0 One requires that people of privilege and power act differently and one requires that minorities (including women in tech and business) step bravely into their own potential.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that the lack of diversity in tech and tech startups can only be solved one person at a time.\u00a0 This is a daunting prospect until you start thinking about it in a microcosm.<\/p>\n<p>Sarah Mei and I decided to do something to make it so the SF Ruby Meetup had more women.\u00a0 There were so few women in the group that we figured that finding 12 more would triple our numbers.\u00a0 Being geeks, we solved it with math.\u00a0 Teach 120-150 women Ruby, expect 10% to be interested and stick around, and our goal would be met.\u00a0 This is a deceptively simple description of the solution, but this simple goal and powerful support from a large number of individual men and women in the group made it work.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m convinced that a large reason the <a href=\"http:\/\/sfrubyworkshops.com\/\">workshops<\/a> have worked is because of the mix of participants &#8212; we typically bring together around 50 women and 25 volunteers.\u00a0 The majority of the women are programmers.\u00a0 The attendees can bring a man to attend as well, so we&#8217;ll always have a handful of guys who are not technical.\u00a0 The volunteers are both men and women who know Ruby on Rails and have a wide range of skills.\u00a0 When you start talking to a stranger at a workshop there is no way you can know by looking at each other whether the other person has a technical background or aptitude and they could be a CEO, an engineer at the top of their career or unemployed.\u00a0 That breaks down stereotypes and creates an incredibly great environment for learning and networking.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I am very excited that this workshop format will be replicated in <a href=\"http:\/\/nycrubyworkshop.com\/\">New York City<\/a> and San Francisco (soon to be <a href=\"http:\/\/sfrubyworkshops.com\/list\/\">announced<\/a>) on the same weekend May 20-22nd.\u00a0 I believe that what is magical about the workshops we have done so far can be replicated in any city by any group of people who genuinely want to share what they know.<\/p>\n<p>As Sarah Mei says &#8220;it&#8217;s a numbers game.&#8221;\u00a0 We&#8217;re creating change through teaching Ruby and Rails to women.\u00a0 You can <a href=\"http:\/\/groups.google.com\/group\/railsbridge-workshops\">join us<\/a> or you can create your own change by reaching out and mentoring someone and by stretching your boundaries.\u00a0 Help someone find their genius&#8230; or find your own.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Alexander B.
