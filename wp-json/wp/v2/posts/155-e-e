As usual, I turned to the Internet for inspiration and once I got on the right track I have found an endless supply of great resources for doing science experiments with supplies easily found around the house and in grocery stores.  It&#8217;s kind of like part-time home-schooling.<\/p>\n<p>Whenever I find good stuff on the web, I am inspired to give back in kind.  So, I&#8217;ve been working on a web site that documents the science experiements that I&#8217;ve done so far.  I hope to inspire other people who are interested in volunteering or who already work with kids.  You don&#8217;t have to be a parent to do it!  Call up your local school and chances are that they would love you to come and work with the kids.<\/p>\n<p>Check out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flyingpaperclips.com\">flyingpaperclips.com<\/a>, named after our most recent science experiment.  My son thinks the name is too silly and that the paperclips were not really flying, they were floating.  He says that I should have name it scienceprojects.com, but he&#8217;s too young to understand the profileration of domain names and that name was taken.  Besides it&#8217;s my site and I like the name.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This school year my weekly volunteering effort has been teaching hands-on science to my son&#8217;s first grade class.
