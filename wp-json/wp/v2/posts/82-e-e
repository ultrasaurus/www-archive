Ever since Thanksgiving, I have heard the daily refrain &#8220;I wish Christmas was tomorrow.&#8221;  Finally it is.  Between then and now, time has passed both quickly and slowly.  Grown-up activities seem to whiz by, while the moments of glue and colors, flour and sugar, paper and scissors stretch into forever.<\/p>\n<p>People always said that internet time moved quickly.  A few months on the net was like a year of normal time.  The pace of software development increased with smaller, more frequent releases.  Innovation became disposable.  &#8220;That&#8217;s so last week,&#8221; was a standard tongue in cheek response.<\/p>\n<p>In other ways, it seemed that time didn&#8217;t pass at all.  When I first started regularly browsing the web in 1995, it felt like an ever-present representation of NOW.  Unlike paper publications, whose back issues collect on library shelves and coffee tables, a web site shows what&#8217;s on the server at the moment.  Unless the publiser tooks archival steps, yesterday&#8217;s news no longer existed.<\/p>\n<p>The folks at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/\">Internet Archive<\/a> are working to ensure that we can still find yesterdays&#8217; news.  This unique endeavor strives to compensate for unusal nature of the digital web.  We can resurrect the past through the magic of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/web\/web.php\">wayback machine<\/a>, but it doesn&#8217;t change our experience of the web.<\/p>\n<p>Weblogs capture the passage of time.  Fundamentally different from traditional website publishing, every entry has a date and time, and achiving is automatic.   The experience changes for both the reader and the publisher.  Its a small place in my grown up life of software development and internet time where I can recapture the feeling of scissors and construction paper, glitter and glue.  As I write an entry, time can stand still for days.  My desktop is strewn with web pages, useful references and distractions.  I collect and discard links.  I read and I think.  I string together ideas as paragraphs in a web form.  It is one of those unexpected reasons to keep a web log.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/sarahblog\/archives\/000063.html\">read more<\/a> top ten reasons for a web log<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In real life, there is nothing like a small child to help you remember the passage of time.
