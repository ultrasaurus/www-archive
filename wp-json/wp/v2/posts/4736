People from various teams got together and brainstormed:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/americanartmuseum\/10892450515\/\" title=\"Luce Foundation Center Hackathon by americanartmuseum, on Flickr\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm8.staticflickr.com\/7313\/10892450515_ce351a794e.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"Luce Foundation Center Hackathon\"><\/a><br \/>\nAfter drawing dozens of ideas, we asked Georgina and Bridget, who were the organizers from the Luce Center, which ideas they liked best.  There were so many great ideas!  The team that organized the brain stretch integrated some of them, and another team mocked up and implemented other ideas.<\/p>\n<p>People were less fixated on winning, than they were to create great solutions to solve real challenges, to make more of our nation&#8217;s treasures accessible to a wider audience.<\/p>\n<p>It was inspiring &#8212; and well worth all of the extra advance work to make it happen.  It was so hard to judge the winners that we ended up making new prizes.
