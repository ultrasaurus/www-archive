I&#8217;ve often noticed how software influences our actions.  User experience is a run-time effect.  In non-social software this pattern has been noted in such effects as &#8220;ransom note&#8221; publishing and verbose word processing.<\/p>\n<p>Social software affects communication patterns, relationships, and identity.  Any new communications medium has these effects.  Leaving a message through a victorian calling card or modern telephone answering machine has implications to the relationship and the content of the message.  As Marshall McLuhuan says &#8220;the medium is the message,&#8221;  in social software the medium influences not only the content of the conversation, but also the character of the speaker and the relationship to the audience.<\/p>\n<p>In real life we have different modes of identity.  Each of us has many facets of our personality, as we get to know each other better we experience a multi-faceted human being.  The setting of an interaction influences who we are at that moment.  If you read a transcript of three conversations: on the phone with my best friend, in the middle of a software debugging session, or in the park, would you know that any of them were me?  You know my identity as seen through my weblog.  Perhaps if I keep writing and you keep reading for years you would notice if my Moveable Type editor were suddenly taken over by a like minded yet different individual, but if you found yourself conversing with a nameless woman at a party, would you know it was me?<\/p>\n<p>I like Clay Shirky&#8217;s notion of a &#8220;handle&#8221; and being difference from &#8220;identity.&#8221;  I even looked in the Thesaurus, but I couldn&#8217;t find a better word for this indentification that is not your complete identity, but is who you become known to be with a particular group.  This kind of identification becomes exagerated through social software.<\/p>\n<p>The article listed guidelines for designing social software whcih resonated with me:<\/p>\n<p>Things to accept:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>&#8220;you cannot completely separate technical and social issues&#8230;the group is real. It will exhibit emergent effects. It can&#8217;t be ignored, and it can&#8217;t be programmed&#8221;\n<li> &#8220;Members are different than users. A pattern will arise in which there is some group of users that cares more than average about the integrity and success of the group as a whole.&#8221;\n<li> &#8220;The core group has rights that trump individual rights in some situations&#8221;\n<\/ol>\n<p>Things to design for:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li> identification (rather than identity): &#8220;design for is handles the user can invest in&#8221;  &#8230; when people communicate they need a sense of history, &#8220;who said what when.&#8221;\n<li> authority: &#8220;design a way for there to be members in good standing&#8221;\n<li>cost of membership: not about dollars, but about making having an investment that is tied to identity.  In Shirky&#8217;s words: &#8220;you need barriers to participation&#8230;The user of social software is the group, not the individual.&#8221;\n<li> protect conversations by limiting scale or by providing an effective outlet when it gets crowded.\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I enjoyed Clay Sharky&#8217;s article, A Group is its Own Worst Enemy.
