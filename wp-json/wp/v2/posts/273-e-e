It creates a \u201cin a positive and encouraging environment.\u201d for learning both concrete computer skills and abstract computer science concepts (Brown University, Artemis Project)<\/p>\n<p>This  discussion reminds me of Shirley Malcom&#8217;s declaration at Grace Hopper 2004 that computer science has a marketing problem, referencing the well-known Edsger Dijkstra quote: \u201cComputer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.&#8221;  If girls got the picture that computers aren&#8217;t about programming, but that it is a powerful way to do accomplish incredible things, then maybe we would have more women getting CS degrees and appearing in software industry.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/sarahblog\/archives\/000212.html\">written<\/a> about this before. Perhaps I should not be surprised that there are so few women in the field, since what I most love about it is not easily seen from the outside.  <a href=\"http:\/\/osteele.com\/blog\/\">Oliver Steele<\/a> once summed it up well in conversation, when he said that in college they teach how to be a computer scientist, learning to be a software engineer is a side-effect.  It is perhaps unavoidable that university classes are all taught by professors who are interested in computer science as an end unto itself, rather than as a means to an end &#8212; you need to do computer science research to qualify.  Most of us who are practicing programmers do it for fundamentally different reasons.  Sure, programming is fun, but that&#8217;s not the point.  The point is to change the world in some small or large way, to have an impact on something or someone outside of the machine.<\/p>\n<p>I would love to hear about more tactics that are making a difference &#8230; what else is going on?  do you know someone who is making a difference?  are you?  if you are a woman in CS, what made a difference for you?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It is good to read about progress from some colleges in creating gender balance in computer science, since the overall trend has been a steady downward curve in the number of female cs grads.
