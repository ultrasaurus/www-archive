As with CoSA, I joined pre-product launch and arguably we&#8217;re still at that point.\u00a0 Last year we made our database of native language videos and translations available on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mightyverse.com\/\">mightyverse.com<\/a> &#8212; our belief is that the business needs to be on mobile platforms, but with a web service as a necessary component, the website made sense to release first.\u00a0 We&#8217;ve been doing what I call &#8220;use case testing&#8221; for about a year using a beta iPhone app.\u00a0 Just last week, we&#8217;ve kicked off a series of market tests starting with <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.mightyverse.com\/2010\/08\/mightysushi-iphoneipad-app\/\">MightySushi<\/a> a mobile app that works on iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch.<\/p>\n<p>With Mightyverse some distance from profitability, I&#8217;m growing an engineering team inside <a href=\"http:\/\/blazingcloud.net\/\">Blazing Cloud<\/a>, a software development consulting company where we build products for other people.\u00a0 We do training, as well as mobile and web development.<\/p>\n<p>Tomorrow I&#8217;ll talk a bit about what I&#8217;ve learned over the last year, why I think it is a good idea to keep the consulting business separate from the product business, what worked, what didn&#8217;t and my daily struggle to make good decisions on how and when to spend time and money and still have fun.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;m excited to speak tomorrow at the Bootstrapper&#8217;s Breakfast, a monthly event held in SF and other bay area cities.\u00a0 There&#8217;s a lot of talk about fund-raising and venture-backed business these days, but there are also a lot of people just making their businesses happen with a series of small steps.
