I expected it to be frustrating, but it was surprisingly fun.  <\/p>\n<h2>Setup<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Set up the pieces facing your opponent without looking at them<\/li>\n<li>Then take turns with one person facing away, the other makes sure that the flag is in the back row, has a trap in front of it and a 8,9,10 or trap on each side, with a fair arrangement of strong pieces.  If you have to make a choice, ask your partner &#8220;pick A or B&#8221; or &#8220;a number between 27 and 39&#8221; and then apply that to your choices so that it is suitably random.  The idea is to make the game fun by being equally challenging.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Gameplay<\/h2>\n<p>Take turns moving pieces.  You need to tell your opponent if he or she tries to move a trap (or a mine in the standard set).  Once you know what a piece is, you turn it around to face you.  Aside from trying and failing to move a trap or a flag, the only way to identify a piece is to attack with it (or be attacked).  You can also pick a piece and ask if it can fly (to identify a dragon), but that takes your whole turn if it isn&#8217;t.  We also decided that if you run out of dwarves (miners) then you can use the next higher piece to take out traps.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/img338.imageshack.us\/img338\/513\/imagenua.jpg\" alt=\"board layout\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This holiday I learned how to play backward Stratego &#8212; a variant of the old strategy game.
