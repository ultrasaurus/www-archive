If you are standing in front of the screen, Shneiderman wonders, how would people behind you be able to see what you&#8217;re doing?&#8221; (via <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/magazine\/112\/open_features-canttouchthis.html\">Fast Company<\/a> via <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bassictech.com\/blogs\/bassictech_news_blog\/archive\/2007\/01\/20\/remapping-the-universe-using-this-gui.aspx\">BassicTech<\/a>) I think the main potential problem is that your arms will get tired; however, the potential risks of RSI didn&#8217;t stop consumer adoption of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Douglas_Engelbart\">Doug Englebart<\/a>&#8216;s mouse.<\/p>\n<p>I do think it would be pretty effective for collaboration. I always find it hard to sit back and just watch someone else &#8220;drive&#8221; when working together on a computer.  Of course, we have a long way to go on collaboration software in general, let alone adapting it to this new paradigm.  Regardless, I applaud Jeff&#8217;s innovation and wish him and his colleagues at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.perceptivepixel.com\/\">Perceptive Pixel<\/a> the best of luck.  I wholeheartedly agree with Jeff Han when he says that &#8220;interfaces should be conforming to us.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Minority report is a must-see movie for UI geeks.
