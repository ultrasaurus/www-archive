He has reached new and astonishing peaks of scientific success. He has produced <strong>machines that think<\/strong> and instruments that peer into the unfathomable ranges of interstellar space\u2026 <\/p>\n<p>Yet, in spite of these spectacular strides in science and technology, and still unlimited ones to come, something basic is missing\u2026 <\/p>\n<p>Our problem today is that <strong>we have allowed the internal to become lost in the external<\/strong>. We have allowed the means by which we live to outdistance the ends for which we live\u2026<\/p>\n<p>We must still face prodigious hilltops of opposition and gigantic mountains of resistance. But with patient and firm determination we will press on until every valley of despair is exalted to new peaks of hope, until every mountain of pride and irrationality is made low by the leveling process of humility and compassion; until the rough places of injustice are transformed into a smooth plane of equality of opportunity; and until the crooked places of prejudice are transformed by the straightening process of bright-eyed wisdom.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Every day corporations accidentally or intentionally use machine learning and automated processes that operate at scale in ways that cause direct harm or incite violence. And in much more subtle ways, we participate in systems that oppress. The civil rights movement succeeded in changing laws, and now we face the challenge of changing our society.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"433\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/CzMFOljSYIk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>via @TheKingCenter: &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheKingCenter\/status\/952668456167657472\">thread of #MLK speeches and sermons<\/a> in which he speaks truth to power, shares about his philosophy of nonviolence and expounds on issues of injustice and what our righteous, rigorous response should be.
