Johnson<\/a> gave a fantastic presentation which unexpectedly challenged some of my own assumptions about rap lyrics.  I enjoy hip hop &#8212; the music, the poetry of the lyrics &#8212; but I have felt disturbed and alienated by some music of that genre which has explicit lyrics which degrade women and celebrate violence.  It was enlightening to hear from a woman in the industry.<\/p>\n<p>She spoke about starting to blog without a particular topic in mind, just about her thoughts and reflections on life.  She became known as a &#8220;feminist hip hop blogger&#8221; without seeking that as role because she sometimes wrote from a feminist perspective about hip hop.  Its funny how an audience can set their own expectations for a writer.  I like hearing about how she thinks about staying true to her own voice.<\/p>\n<p>Lynne spoke about being challenged as a woman in a powerful role (as an editor of Spin and Vibe) that she and other sisters were not outspoken enough against mysoginistic lyrics.  She responded with a thoughful post, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lynnedjohnson.com\/diary\/000428.html\">who&#8217;s gonna&#8217; take the weight?<\/a>,  that cites many excellent articles written on the subject.  In particular, she posted in its entirety an essay by Bell Hooks, &#8220;Misogyny, gangsta rap, and The Piano,&#8221;  ZMagazine, February 1994.<\/p>\n<p>Bell Hooks notes that &#8220;gangsta rap as a reflection of dominant values in our culture rather than as an aberrant &#8216;pathologica&#8217; standpoint&#8230;Rather than being viewed as a subversion or disruption of the norm we would need to see it as an embodiment of the norm.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Isolated in my bourgeois, predominantly white world, where mysogyny is discussed in safe discussions amongst the like-minded, it never occurred to me that these young black men are just telling it like it is.  George Fox, one of the founding Quakers, did not merely create a creed of non-violent action in his peace testimony; he spoke about taking away &#8220;the occasion of all wars.&#8221;  Could we take away from our society the underlying currents of hatred and violence that produce such lyrics?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I was intrigued by this blogher session with the subtitle: &#8220;negotiating a space dominated by men.&#8221; As a software engineer, I often find myself the lone woman in a roomfull of men.
