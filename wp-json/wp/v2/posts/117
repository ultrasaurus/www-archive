I just read  &#8220;Do Women Lack Ambition?&#8221; by Anna Fels (via <a href=\"http:\/\/www.danah.org\">danah<\/a> at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.misbehaving.net\/2004\/04\/do_women_lack_a.html\">misbehaving.net<\/a>):<\/p>\n<p><i>Women now experience the most powerful social and institutional discrimination during their twenties and early thirties, after they have left the educational system and started pursuing their ambitions. At the age when women most frequently marry and have children, they must decide whether to try to hold on to their own ambitions or downsize or abandon them. Often, a young woman must make this decision at the moment when she is just learning to be a parent, with all its attendant fears, pleasures, insecurities, and around-the-clock work.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>Although it is not stated as such, the focus of the article is on ambitions to succeed professionally in fields traditionally reserved for men.  More women than men have ambitions to raise the next generation and to create that special relationship with a child that can lead to a healthy happy grown-up.  One could argue the clear biological basis for this imbalance.  After all, men are ill-equipped for the bearing of children.  However, I know many men who value relationships and family and struggle against common expectations and sexism that limits the role of a man in our society.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Downsizing&#8221; professional ambition to be a parent is a <i>different<\/i> ambition, not a <i>lack<\/i> of ambition.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A recent weekend was filled with T-ball, two playdates and a sleepover.
