Today at <a href=\"http:\/\/capitalcamp.org\/\">CapitalCamp<\/a> he talked about why they chose Drupal for <a href=\"http:\/\/georgia.gov\/\">georgia.gov<\/a> and how they approached the transition.  <\/p>\n<p>Georgia.gov, as the website for the Georgia state government, used to be simply a landing page with links.  They wanted it to be a front door to wherever you wanted to go in the state government, but people were coming there and falling off.  They had a fragmented experience, a fragmented brand.  They were running many different CMS&#8217;s.  They had both platform issues and a design challenge.<\/p>\n<p>Their users don\u2019t look like typical personas.  They are trying to be a website for everyone, to serve the whole population.  How do they do this?  Here are my rough notes on this intriguing talk.<\/p>\n<h2>Platform Choice<\/h2>\n<p>Since they were running a lot of CMS&#8217;s, they knew exactly what they needed:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>to have an enterprise element, they were hosting 60-70 websites<\/li>\n<li>cost effective (not saying cheap) &#8212; worthwhile, but doesn\u2019t cost as much as others<\/li>\n<li>simple and usable<\/li>\n<li>strong presence in the public sector<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Nikhil Deshpande stated that Drupal is the second largest CMS worldwide, 2.1% of the web.  [note: <a href=\"http:\/\/w3techs.com\/technologies\/overview\/content_management\/all\">w3techs reports<\/a> Drupal as #3 at 2%, which is still pretty huge, but perhaps Joomla has grown in the past few years.]<\/p>\n<h3>Open Source!<\/h3>\n<p>Nikhail saw this as opportunity to answer valid questions about open source solutions, since they were moving from mostly proprietary systems.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>security?  high threshold of security since it has so many eyes on it<\/li>\n<li>free?  how good can it be if it is free?  It\u2019s not free.  It\u2019s free as in free speech, not free beer.<\/li>\n<li>total cost of ownership?  you need to implement it and host it<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Who uses it? \u00a0Huge number of government sites, including go.usa.gov, USDA, NASA, Dept of Justice, USAID, and many more.<\/p>\n<p>You can either implement it yourself or get someone to implement it for you.  They sent out a bid and chose Phase 2 as a partner. Then Phase 2 brought in Acquia (started by the founder of Drupal) and mediacurrent.  They decided to use OpenPublic platform, which is built very specifically for the government.  It\u2019s a distribution of Drupal that you can customize or use out-of-the-box.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>tailored to the needs of govt<\/li>\n<li>security<\/li>\n<li>accessibility<\/li>\n<li>workflow<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Moving from Vignette to Drupal<\/h3>\n<p>Content: Oracle to MySQL<br \/>\nLook and feel &#8212; not just a migration, decided to do a re-design.<br \/>\nSingle code-base, multiple databases<br \/>\nCloud hosting &#8212; all public info, no sensitive data<br \/>\nSearch<br \/>\nMobile ready &#8211; 20% of traffic overall (and climbing), some websites up to 45%<\/p>\n<h2>Design<\/h2>\n<p>Internal team designed the main site, then Phase 2 did the rest of the websites<br \/>\ndid heat maps &#8212; search 31% clicks, child support 13%, headlines 3.6%<\/p>\n<p>Made it very search centric.
