There are some activities in my life that I have discovered are symptoms of happiness. My garden blooms, I write, I do the dishes in the morning, and I take longer walks with my dog.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know that they actually make me happy. I don&#8217;t particularly like to write, it&#8217;s a way of thinking through things and connecting with other people in quiet, unexpected ways. Writing makes me just a little uncomfortable, but it helps somehow to send these thoughts outside of my head.<\/p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t say I always love gardening. It&#8217;s kind of boring, but more interesting than meditation and with some similar positive effects. I like how I feel afterwards, and it makes me happy every time I walk by and see colorful splashes of color and so many shades of green.<\/p>\n<p>These small acts of taking care of myself and being present in my surroundings are indicators. I try to notice when they stop, when the weeds grow wild, when I don&#8217;t take time to write and the coffee cups pile up in the sink. Today I noticed that I was gardening and it wasn&#8217;t even necessary, and I&#8217;ve been taking longer walks in the morning. I still struggle and have doubts and there&#8217;s all sorts of awful in the world, but when we go out there to face the world, I think we all need a couple of leading indicators of happiness.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Digging in the dirt, pulling weeds, planting flowers&#8230; these things make me feel at peace.
