My brief notes from April 2018 Internet Identity Workshop (below) still feel relevant a year later.<\/p>\n<p>If we believe that a particular person is trust-worthy, to trust their digital representation, we somehow need to identify that some bits that travel across wires or air actually originate from that person.<\/p>\n<p>In today&#8217;s Web, we have a network of trusted authorities, typically my social network or email provider creates a relationship with me and I prove my identity with a password. The challenge is that they also house all of my personal data &#8212; could there be a way for me to identify myself without making myself vulnerable to the whims or errors of these companies?  New models are emerging.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mobile Drivers License: British Columbia and U.S. Commerce Department&#8217;s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have funded development of a new kind of digital ID. Folks are working on ways to validate the identity and &#8220;claims&#8221; of an individual. This is not just for fraud detection. It also potentially protects the privacy of an individual, in contrast to a traditional drivers license, where I must reveal my home address while proving that I&#8217;m over 21.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Decentralized Identifier (DID): a standard way for individuals and organizations to create permanent, globally unique, cryptographically verifiable identifiers entirely under the identity owner\u2019s control. <a href=\"https:\/\/sovrin.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Sovrin-Protocol-and-Token-White-Paper.pdf\">Sovrin Foundation Whitepaper<\/a><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>With blockchains, every public key can now have its own address, enabling a decentralized self-service registry for public keys.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Trust without shared secrets. In cryptography we typically share a secret which allows us to decrypt future messages. But the best way to keep a secret is not to tell anyone. We can actually verify a secret without knowing it. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/2018\/04\/zero-knowledge-proof-trust-without-shared-secrets\/\">Zero-knowledge proof<\/a><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Object capabilities. In the real world we have physical objects that we can transfer for very specific authorization (e.g. a key to your car) whereas digital keys must be kept secret to avoid replication &#8212; what if authorization were couple with objects in the digital world.
