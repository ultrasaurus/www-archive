As he got into code snippets, he inserted interstitial images every few slides (removed from the slides below).\u00a0 The first time it happened, he mentioned that he wanted to keep everyone&#8217;s attention. \u00a0 It had the reverse effect.\u00a0 This technique was distracting and disrespectful to an audience who, frankly, is turned on by code.\u00a0 This crowd had just watch hour upon hour of code slide shows and live irb sessions, often on the edge of their seats as they absorbed the latest whiz-bang plugin or coding technique from one of the masters.<\/p>\n<p>My point is not whether pornography is good or bad.\u00a0 I personally have no issue with it as long as it is created and viewed by consenting adults.\u00a0 Watching pornography in the privacy of one&#8217;s own home or sex club is entirely different from unexpectedly sharing the experience with a couple of hundred Ruby enthusiasts.\u00a0 I imagine that there were many men in the audience who were as uncomfortable as I.<\/p>\n<p>What most pisses me off is that I had to write this blog post, instead of one about Ruby &amp; CouchDB, which is a far more interesting topic.\u00a0 Thankfully dedicated Pivotal live blogger, Ryan Dy, captured <a href=\"http:\/\/pivotallabs.com\/users\/rdy\/blog\/articles\/801-gogaruco-09-couchdb-ruby-perform-like-a-pr0n-star-matt-aimonetti\">notes on the talk<\/a> sans porn.<\/p>\n<div id=\"__ss_1310834\" style=\"width: 425px;text-align: left\"><a style=\"font:14px Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif;margin:12px 0 3px 0;text-decoration:underline\" title=\"CouchDB: Perform like a pr0n star\" href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/mattetti\/couchdb-perform-like-a-pr0n-star?type=presentation\">CouchDB: Perform like a pr0n star<\/a><\/p>\n<div style=\"font-size: 11px;font-family: tahoma,arial;height: 26px;padding-top: 2px\">View more <a style=\"text-decoration:underline\" href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/\">presentations<\/a> from <a style=\"text-decoration:underline\" href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/mattetti\">Matt Aimonetti<\/a>.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Golden Gate Ruby Conference was almost totally awesome.\u00a0 There only two sour notes.\u00a0 First, it was almost unbelievable how few women attended.\u00a0 With about 200 attendees, six were women.\u00a0 I have never been to a technical conference with so disproportionately few women.\u00a0 I can think of all sorts of reasons (along with a number&hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/2009\/04\/gender-and-sex-at-gogaruco\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":84,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[9],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1154"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/84"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1154"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1154\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1154"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1154"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1154"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
