It was really fun to see giant dinosaurs in action, even if you could tell that they were puppets and huge contraptions on rollers.  The light show was inventive and created a wonderful atmosphere with few props and stage settings.<\/p>\n<p>For the most part, they did a good job of explaining what was fairly well established vs. what was not well understood, for which the paleontologists had theories that were mostly guesswork.  However, I was puzzled by one statement about the plateousaurus which lived in the very dry Triassic period.  The narrator reported of this dinosaur that &#8220;to conserve liquid, she doesn&#8217;t sweat, or even pee.&#8221; How, I wondered, could they possibly know that from the fossil record?<\/p>\n<p>I could read about <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dinosaurian_physiology\">Dinosaurian physiology<\/a> with interesting discussions of whether they were warm or cold-blooded, but I could find no reference of what we know about dinosaur sweat or urine. I did find a site where I could <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nm.blm.gov\/features\/blm_paleo\/ask.html\">ask a paleontologist<\/a>.  I was thrilled when Patricia Hester wrote back quite quickly:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a very good question.   The statement could be derived from the<br \/>\nenvironmental data collected from the rocks where the fossil material  was<br \/>\ndiscovered, the understanding of the climate during the time the animals<br \/>\nlived and the configuration of the continents during the  Triassic.  From<br \/>\nmy understanding, the fossil material is all from Europe.  The sedimentary<br \/>\nrocks provide data that allow for interpretation of what is called &#8221; the<br \/>\ndepositional environment&#8221; where the rocks were formed.  That&#8217;s why &#8221; the<br \/>\ncontext&#8221; (the rocks) where  the fossil material is discovered is  important<br \/>\nto document when  researchers discover fossils.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The depositional environments, continental configuration and climate<br \/>\nsuggest that these animals inhabited a dry and hot world.  The narrator may<br \/>\nhave been making the &#8220;leap&#8221;  from animals inhabiting similar climates in<br \/>\nmodern ecosystems conserve moisture by reducing water loss to this extinct<br \/>\nearly dinosaur.   There are modern desert mammals that don&#8217;t &#8220;pee&#8221; any<br \/>\nliquid.. but eliminate wastes in solid form.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not aware of any fossil evidence from the bones themselves that would<br \/>\nprovide this interpretation.  However, there is always current research<br \/>\nongoing and it&#8217;s hard to keep up with it all.   Since bones are living<br \/>\ntissue during an animals life, there certainly could be something I don&#8217;t<br \/>\nknow that could support the statement from the movie.  I just don&#8217;t know<br \/>\nabout it.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The web site, <a href=\"http:\/\/jan.ucc.nau.edu\/~rcb7\/Triassic.html\">http:\/\/jan.ucc.nau.edu\/~rcb7\/Triassic.html<\/a>,  shows what earth looked like during the late Triassic<br \/>\n&#8230; and Europe was near the center of a large continent.. as a result..<br \/>\nvery dry.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Now, I wonder what modern day animals don&#8217;t sweat or pee :)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We saw Walking with Dinosaurs on last Sunday before New Year&#8217;s in the San Jose Arean.
