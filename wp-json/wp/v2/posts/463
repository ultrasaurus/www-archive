Dave Astels refers to the Sapir-Whorf theory in his <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sapir-Whorf_hypothesis\">talk on behavior driven development<\/a>.  He describes that Sapir-Whorf &#8220;challenges the possibility of perfectly representing the world with language, because it implies that the mechanisms of any language condition the thoughts of its speaker community.&#8221;  Dave argues that the use of the word &#8220;test&#8221; in test-driven development (TDD) causes programmers to focus on validating the inner state of their code rather than in verifying the expected result, as in behavior-driven development (BDD).  In large part changing the language we use to describe how we validate out code leads us to develop a more effective and resilient form of code validation.<\/p>\n<p>While <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sapir-Whorf_hypothesis\">wikipedia<\/a> cites some arguments against this theory, it seems intuitive to me.  In fact whether learning a spoken language or a programming language I have found that the language I am thinking in does in fact change how I think.  For a spoken language, specific words will have different connotations. In a different language, I&#8217;ll use different idioms and patterns of words that lead me to express a subtly different meaning, to focus on a specific aspect of what I am seeking to communicate.  For programming, the choice of language will influence how I solve a specific problem.  It makes sense to pick a specific language for a task in order to influence the flavor of solution that results.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;A language that doesn&#8217;t affect the way you think about programming is not worth knowing.&#8221;\u00a0 &#8212; A.
