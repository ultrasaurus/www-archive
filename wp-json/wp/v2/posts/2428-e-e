Her main professional focus is front-end HTML, CSS and Javascript, but she has worked consistently to help make these events happen, taking on some of the critical behind-the-scenes jobs that glue an event together. I&#8217;m so excited that she has agreed to take on a leadership role. <\/p>\n<p>I got to know Amy Chen through her volunteering at the most recent <a href=\"http:\/\/sfrubyworkshops.com\/2010\/03\/workshops-continue-in-2010\/\">worshop<\/a>.  She agreed to &#8220;shadow&#8221; me during this event in preparation for leading the next workshop with Melanie.  We got to talking about Javascript and I mentioned how I did test-driven Ruby, but had never done that with Javascript.  She said she had done a lot of work with Selenium and somehow we hatched the idea of an evening workshop.  At the last minute I turned it into a fundraiser since the February outreach workshop didn&#8217;t break even.  She hadn&#8217;t taught Selenium before, nor given a hands-on training in this format, but she stepped up.  I had so much fun in one of her prep sessions creating my first-ever test-driven jQuery&#8230; so cool.  She even volunteered to teach a crew of interns I was training that week, since I had come to the realization that Javascript, HTML and CSS were as essential a foundation as is the Ruby language and SQL to a Rails engineer. The Selenium workshop was a success and I look forward to seeing Amy join Melanie in leading the next Outreach workshop.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/img.skitch.com\/20100325-8cpuaks2bk8wjtq9at46a77enw.png\" \/> <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In honor of Ada Lovelace Day, I&#8217;ve chosen to highlight Amy Chen and Melanie Archer.
