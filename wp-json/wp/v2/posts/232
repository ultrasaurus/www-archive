It&#8217;s a structured experience &#8212; it&#8217;s <em>work<\/em> after all.  There&#8217;s a goal.  I have a partner and a time limit.  There is even a compiler that enforces some of the rules.  And it is wildly fun.  I put on my headphones and listen to pandora as I tap away at the keyboard.  There&#8217;s a thrill of excitement when things work as planned.  There&#8217;s even a joy to the struggle to discover what&#8217;s went wrong when they don&#8217;t.

I think the difference is when the activity is not artifical, when it has a purpose.  Nonetheless I applaud Amy Jo Kim&#8217;s effort to put fun in functional.  I absolutely agree that we should all be writing software that helps people acheive their goals while having a good time.  Positive feelings and emotional engagement make us more creative, flexible and productive; but even if that were not true, enabling the pursuit of happiness is not just a good idea, it&#8217;s a constitutional right.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I enjoyed slides from Amy Jo Kim&#8217;s talk at Etech (via LukeW).
