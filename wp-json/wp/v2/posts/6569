I&#8217;ve attempted to reproduce this simple explanation below, also noting additional sources and related articles.<\/p>\n<p>Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZPKs) are very useful when applied to internet identity &#8212; with an interactive exchange you can prove you know a secret without actually revealing the secret.<\/p>\n<p>Understanding Zero Knowledge Proofs with simple math:<\/p>\n<h3>x -> f(x)<\/h3>\n<p>Simple one way function. Easy to go one way from <code>x<\/code> to <code>f(x)<\/code> but mathematically hard to go from <code>f(x)<\/code> to <code>x.<\/code><\/p>\n<p>The most common example is a hash function. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2016\/06\/hacker-lexicon-password-hashing\/\">Wired: What is Password Hashing?<\/a> provides an accessible introduction to why hash functions are important to cryptographic applications today.<\/p>\n<h3>f(x) = g ^ x mod p<\/h3>\n<p>Known(public): <code>g<\/code>, <code>p<\/code><br \/>\n* <code>g<\/code> is a constant<br \/>\n* <code>p<\/code> has to be prime<\/p>\n<p>Easy to know <code>x<\/code> and compute <code>g ^ x mod p<\/code> but difficult to do in reverse.<\/p>\n<h3>Interactive Proof<\/h3>\n<p>Alice wants to prove Bob that she knows <code>x<\/code> without giving any information about <code>x<\/code>. Bob already knows <code>f(x)<\/code>.  Alice can make <code>f(x)<\/code> public and then prove that she knows <code>x<\/code> through an interactive exchange with anyone on the Internet, in this case, Bob.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Alice publishes f(x): <code>g^x mod p<\/code><\/li>\n<li>Alice picks random number <code>r<\/code><\/li>\n<li>Alice sends Bob <code>u<\/code> = g^r mod p<\/li>\n<li>Now Bob has artifact based on that random number, but can&#8217;t actually calculate the random number<\/li>\n<li>Bob returns a challenge <code>e<\/code>. Either 0 or 1<\/li>\n<li>Alice responds with <code>v<\/code>:<br \/>\nIf 0, <code>v = r<\/code><br \/>\nIf 1, <code>v = r + x<\/code><\/li>\n<li>Bob can now calculate:<br \/>\nIf e == 0: Bob has the random number <code>r<\/code>, as well as the publicly known variables and can check if <code>u == g^v mod p<\/code><br \/>\nIf e == 1: <code>u*f(x) = g^v (mod p)<\/code><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I believe step 6 is true based on <a href=\"https:\/\/proofwiki.org\/wiki\/Congruence_of_Powers\">Congruence of Powers<\/a>, though I&#8217;m not sure that I&#8217;ve transcribed e==1 case accurately with my limited ascii representation.<\/p>\n<p>If <code>r<\/code> is true random, equally distributed between zero and <code>(p-1)<\/code>, this does not leak any information about <code>x<\/code>, which is pretty neat, yet not sufficient.<\/p>\n<p>In order to ensure that Alice cannot be impersonated, multiple iterations are required along with the use of large numbers (see <a href=\"http:\/\/iiw.idcommons.net\/Zero_Knowledge_Proofs_101\">IIW session notes<\/a>).<\/p>\n<h2>Further Reading<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.stat.berkeley.edu\/users\/aldous\/157\/Papers\/fagin.pdf\">Comparing Information Without Leaking It<\/a> Ronald Fagin, Moni Naor, Peter Winkler, 1996.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/people.csail.mit.edu\/silvio\/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers\/Proof%20Systems\/The_Knowledge_Complexity_Of_Interactive_Proof_Systems.pdf\">The Knowledge Complexity of Interactive Proof-Systems<\/a>: original 1985 paper by Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali, and Charles Rackoff<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/pages.cs.wisc.edu\/~mkowalcz\/628.pdf\">How to Explain Zero-Knowledge Protocols to Your Children<\/a> Quisquater, Jean-Jacques; Guillou, Louis C.; Berson, Thomas A.
