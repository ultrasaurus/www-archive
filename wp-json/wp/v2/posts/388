It think they have a good approach by getting feedback from people using apps before they open up the APIs to developers.  I have always believed that to get the UI right, you need the user experience to drive the APIs not the other way round.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Key Features<\/strong><br \/>\n* Drag-and-drop from the desktop to the browser (my favorite!)<br \/>\n* Upload to FlickR<br \/>\n* Desktop Notifier (integrating with Growl on the Mac and Snarl on Windows)<br \/>\n* Image editing: rotate, crop, and effects: &#8216;sepia&#8217;, &#8216;swirl&#8217;, &#8216;solarize&#8217;, &#8216;oil_paint&#8217;, and &#8216;grayscale&#8217;.<br \/>\n* Text-to-Speech<br \/>\n* PStore (local storage: I wonder what the limit is here)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Geek Features<\/strong><br \/>\n* Ruby Interpreter<br \/>\n* JSONRequest<br \/>\n* IRC Client<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/browserplus.yahoo.com\/services\/\">API documentation<\/a> is available, but right now you can only use it if you work for Yahoo.  However, with the documentation out there, including a slick doc browser, they seem pretty serious about opening this up to external developers.<\/p>\n<p>BrowserPlus also has a plugin architecture, so the features can be updated without restarting the browser or even refreshing the page!  This will put them in a very good position when it comes to adoption, but the way they present the plugins is a bit odd from an end user perspective.  I can dig allowing Yahoo to install an image editor, but do I really care that the app I&#8217;m using is written in Ruby?  I&#8217;ve got a little security geek background and I don&#8217;t even understand implications of allowing a &#8220;RubyInterpreter&#8221;  to be installed &#8212; is it sandboxed?  does it allow file system access?  This is weird territory from a usability perspective.  How&#8217;s a normal person to tell what&#8217;s safe or not?  Hard to tell what the model is here&#8230; am I trusting the site or trusting the software vendor?  Right now they are the same for BrowserPlus, but they&#8217;ll need to clarify this before they open it up<\/p>\n<p><strong>Installation Experience<\/strong><br \/>\nContinuing with my series evaluating the initial experience for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/sarahblog\/archives\/000424.html\">Adobe Air and Gears<\/a>, here&#8217;s a click-through slide show of getting started with BrowserPlus:<\/p>\n<div style=\"width:425px;text-align:left\" id=\"__ss_453927\">\n<div style=\"font-size:11px;font-family:tahoma,arial;height:26px;padding-top:2px\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/?src=embed\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.slideshare.net\/swf\/logo_embd.png\" style=\"border:0px none;margin-bottom:-5px\" alt=\"SlideShare\" \/><\/a> | <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/sarah.allen\/browswerplus-install?src=embed\" title=\"View BrowswerPlus Install on SlideShare\">View<\/a> | <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/upload?src=embed\">Upload your own<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><small>Privacy Policy<\/p>\n<p>BrowserPlus may gather, store and transmit to Yahoo! the following anonymous information about your usage of the BrowserPlus for diagnostic and software improvement purposes:<br \/>\no\tYour device&#8217;s platform (i.e., osx, win 32, XP).<br \/>\no\tThe version number of BrowserPlus that you have installed.<br \/>\no\tA unique identifier assigned to your installation of BrowserPlus.

Are you kidding me?  How about you just use an English work like &#8220;extension&#8221; or even to quasi-english &#8220;plugin&#8221; &#8212; I think it just confuses people to create new language for an old concept.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><br \/>\nBrowserPlus is a promising new contender in this space with a new angle.  Even though AIR and Gears have been out (at least for developers) for a while, there is no clear winner and I don&#8217;t expect that to be decided for a while yet.  BrowserPlus worth watching.
