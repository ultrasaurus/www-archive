I&#8217;m not sure if it was a bug or if they planned it this way, but I couldn&#8217;t record anything longer than 4 seconds.  It&#8217;s focus is live tv, but without a live audience I thought I would check out its recording features.  I took me a few seconds to set up the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ustream.tv\/channel\/ultrasaurus\">ultrasaurus<\/a> channel.  I found the interface to be a bit overwhelming and didn&#8217;t manage to record a clip longer than 4 seconds.<\/p>\n<p>This is the broadcast\/record interface:<br \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/images\/blog\/ustream\/2-initial-screen.png\" \/><br \/>\nI think they should hide what appears to be a debug log in the info tab on the right and make it so the panel with all the video\/audio controls is hidden by default.  It&#8217;s way too overwhelming for the newbie and once you are settled into the UI, you don&#8217;t need those controls anyhow.<\/p>\n<p>I though it was an interesting approach to show the recorded video appears on the right after you stop recording.  I think that provides a visual cue that you have actually created a file.  The live cam on the left might distract some folks, but it could be useful if I had recorded a snippet and continued on with a live show (assuming that&#8217;s a feature).<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/images\/blog\/ustream\/3-preview.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For reference, here&#8217;s the recording UI Flow:<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/images\/blog\/ustream\/1-security.png\">security dialog<\/a> appears when the window opens<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/images\/blog\/ustream\/2-initial-screen.png\">initial screen<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/images\/blog\/ustream\/2-recording.png\">recording<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/images\/blog\/ustream\/3-preview.png\">preview<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/images\/blog\/ustream\/7-saved.png\">saved<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s neat to see that there are a number of sites using the broadcast and recording features of Flash video.
