It&#8217;s got some interesting tidbits about community building on open source projects and some controversial banter about the role of women.  Notes below &#8212; my comments in <em>italics<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Community managers are often women. Someone noted that this project had more women than any other open source project she had been involved with.  Is this a great thing where we&#8217;re seeing more women in open source?  or is this the-women-taking-care-of-the-kids thing again? &#8212; <em>ouch.  I&#8217;d say yes, to both questions<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;coding is fun, and it is an awesome feeling to fix a bug or add a feature, but the human connection is even more rewarding. &#8212; <em>yeah, I like the human connection stuff too, but sometimes it is really hard to carve out time to code.  It certainly isn&#8217;t one of those socialized female traits to ask whether this newbie&#8217;s future contribution is really more valuable than whatever you are working on. <\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8230;Women may be drawn to these roles, but there are also a lot of men are very good at that.  <em>Absolutely.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8230;gnome love mailing list offers a great approach. People will give you something bite-sized to work on.   The neat thing about these tasks is that it&#8217;s not just easier for the new contributor, you also need a much smaller commitment from the mentor.   It is a way for a contributor to start small and many folks start there and then take on more central tasks.<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;should we target some kind of stamp-of-approval for a women-friendly project?  No, we should lower the barrier for all contributors.  Frankly, with open source, you do need to elbow your way in.  It is pretty intimidating to a lot people not just women.  If you make it less intimidating to join your project, you will get more kinds of people, not just women.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I listened to a podcast interview with a number of women who are mentors in the google highly open participation contest (which offers prizes to 13-18 year olds who contribute to open source projects).
