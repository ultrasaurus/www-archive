It makes sense to teach that way since it is easy to see which share same beginning (consonant) sound or ending (vowel) sound.<\/p>\n<p>However, I knew the characters once and wanted to make my study session more interesting. I had forgotten about half the characters since first studying Japanese four years ago and wanted to review using actual words. If I could learn the characters with the context of real language then I could learn vocabulary at the same time. I wondered if there were a &#8220;quick brown fox&#8221; (<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pangram\">pangram<\/a>) for Hiragana.<\/p>\n<p>I quickly found <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Iroha\">\u3044\u308d\u306f<\/a> (iroha) an ancient Japanese poem:<\/p>\n<p>\u3044\u308d\u306f\u306b\u307b\u3078\u3068<br \/>\n\u3061\u308a\u306c\u308b\u3092<br \/>\n\u308f\u304b\u3088\u305f\u308c\u305d<br \/>\n\u3064\u306d\u306a\u3089\u3080<br \/>\n\u3046\u3090\u306e\u304a\u304f\u3084\u307e<br \/>\n\u3051\u3075\u3053\u3048\u3066<br \/>\n\u3042\u3055\u304d\u3086\u3081\u307f\u3057<br \/>\n\u3091\u3072\u3082\u305b\u3059<\/p>\n<p>This poem not just an arcane bit of trivia, but a real ABCs of Japanese, where the ordering from the poem is still used today.  I found a wonderful video <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-kmtHTUUCvI\">What is &#8220;\u3044\u308d\u306f iroha&#8221;?<\/a> that tells the story of this word which means &#8220;basic&#8221; or &#8220;fundamental&#8221; in Japanese.  I learned that the first 7 characters are used for musical notes (the way we use A-G, in Japanese they use \u3044\u308d\u306f\u306b\u307b\u3078\u3068.  I read elsewhere that theater seats are often ordered this way.<\/p>\n<p>I realized that if I could learn this poem, I would also learn other useful aspects of the Japanese language and a glimpse of the culture as well.  I wanted to hear it while I studied, and found answers via my new twitter friend Charelle Collett (<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Charcol1900\">@Charcol1900<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s someone singing it in a child-like ABCs &#8212; no idea what the words on the right are, but this is the very clear to follow along and practice reading while hearing the characters pronounced:<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"433\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/NTkyIW6eX8E?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>and here&#8217;s Hatsune Miku (Vocal software) singing it:<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"433\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/oESk9EUP4VA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>This second one is really interesting since it also shows the evolution of early Japanese script into modern Hiragana and then shows some more variants &#8212; here&#8217;s some detail on the first three.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Man%27y%C5%8Dgana\">Man&#8217;y\u014dgana<\/a>: an ancient writing system that employs Chinese characters to represent the Japanese language<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hiragana#History\">Chinese Cursive Script<\/a> from which Hiragana evolved<\/li>\n<li>Modern Hiragana<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today I learned about \u3044\u308d\u306f (iroha) a different way to learn Hiragana than the goj\u016bon (\u4e94\u5341\u97f3) ordering I learned in my Japanese class, where the characters are displayed in a grid.
