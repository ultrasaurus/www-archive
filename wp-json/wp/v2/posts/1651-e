I evaluated four plugins for admin UI, using the following methodology: <\/p>\n<p><code><br \/>\nrails xxx_simple<br \/>\ncd xxx_simple\/<br \/>\n.\/script\/generate scaffold Task title:string notes:text  complete:boolean<br \/>\nrake db:migrate<br \/>\n<\/code> <\/p>\n<p>plus whatever annotations to the code the plugin needed.  Then I ran a little script to generate 500 records:<\/p>\n<p><code> 500.times do |counter|<br \/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;`curl -X POST -d \"Another thing #{counter}More text with #{counter} thing\" -H \"Content-Type: application\/xml\" http:\/\/localhost:3000\/tasks.xml`<br \/>\nend<br \/>\n<\/code><br \/>\nThey all support related models, but I only have screen shots from my simple test.  I&#8217;ve listed them below with the ones I liked best at the top.  <\/p>\n<h2>typus<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/github.com\/fesplugas\/typus\/tree\/master\">Typus<\/a> is the one I&#8217;m moving forward with. It has a clean interface and has nice configuration options. You can configure which columns are displayed and which are searched (with a nice UI touch of displaying the search criteria under the search box).  It is actively maintained with quite a few contributors and a responsive <a href=\"http:\/\/groups.google.com\/group\/typus\">google group<\/a>.  I really like how relationships are displayed (for which I don&#8217;t have a picture, sorry).  The only drawback (for me) is that it has its own auth and I don&#8217;t really want to introduce a separate set of admin users for the project I am working on, and I&#8217;ll be looking into making a change to support my own auth.\u00a0 By default, it adds it&#8217;s own typus_users table, but this could be a plus for some.<\/p>\n<p><code><br \/>\nscript\/plugin install git:\/\/github.com\/fesplugas\/typus.git<br \/>\nscript\/generate typus<br \/>\nrake db:migrate<br \/>\n.\/script\/server<br \/>\n<code><\/p>\n<p>Now visit http:\/\/localhost:3000\/admin and you will be prompted for your email address, from which it will automatically create the first admin user (pretty slick).  The default UI looks like this:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/img.skitch.com\/20090705-fkut2mh3se18h2acxbfh1msgg4.jpg\" \/><br \/>\n<img src=\"http:\/\/img.skitch.com\/20090705-qxnawftfwf9na6m4eacejxy41h.jpg\" \/> I ran into just one glitch where Rails reported \"A copy of ApplicationController has been removed from the module tree but is still active!\" but it was <a href=\"http:\/\/groups.google.com\/group\/typus\/browse_thread\/thread\/70fba777518e26e\">easily fixed<\/a>.  The error didn't happen in my simple project, but did in my real app.  Francesc Esplugas has looked into it and so far <a href=\"http:\/\/groups.google.es\/group\/typus\/msg\/051eff4f5089c5f9?hl=en\">can't reproduce it<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>admin_data<\/h2>\n<p>I really liked <a href=\"http:\/\/github.com\/neerajdotname\/admin_data\/tree\/master\">admin_data<\/a>.  The simplicity of the install was breath-taking:<br \/>\n<code><br \/>\nruby script\/plugin install git:\/\/github.com\/neerajdotname\/admin_data.git<br \/>\nsudo gem install will_paginate<br \/>\n.\/script\/server<br \/>\n<\/code><\/p>\n<p>that's it. Now visit http:\/\/localhost:3000\/admin_data and you'll see the following interface:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/img.skitch.com\/20090705-gs9rwj23bdn6au6d9ahekca3te.jpg\" \/><br \/>\n<img src=\"http:\/\/img.skitch.com\/20090705-cj86eyr95cjnbw1gn7k1b3taq8.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I didn't try it, but I really like the admin_data approach to integrating with the application's authentication:  Add the following lines of code in an initializer at ~\/config\/initializers\/admin_data.rb<\/p>\n<p><code><br \/>\n# authorization check to see if the data should be shown to the user<br \/>\nADMIN_DATA_VIEW_AUTHORIZATION = Proc.new { |controller|<br \/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp; controller.send(\"admin_logged_in?\") }<br \/>\n# authorization check to see if the user should be allowed to update the data<br \/>\nADMIN_DATA_UPDATE_AUTHORIZATION    = Proc.new { |controller| return false }<br \/>\n<\/code><\/p>\n<h2>streamlined<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/streamlinedframework.org\/\">Streamlined<\/a> is nice, but not as pretty as ActiveScaffold.  Not compatible with Rails 2.3.  This and active_scaffold seem to be a little older than typus and admin_data and require you to modify your code similarly.  I thought it nice that it provided its own admin layout.   In my simple test I applied the series of steps and nested route as with <a href=\"\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/sarahblog\/2009\/07\/getting-started-with-activescaffold\/\">active_scaffold<\/a>.<br \/>\n<code><br \/>\n  class MyNiftyController &lt; ApplicationController<br \/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;layout &#039;streamlined&#039;<br \/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;acts_as_streamlined<\/p>\n<p>    ...[anything else you want to do]<br \/>\n  end<br \/>\n<\/code><br \/>\n<img src=\"http:\/\/img.skitch.com\/20090702-n3wgfmeh4wiq1k7bhfpj3fw79a.jpg\" \/><br \/>\n<img src=\"http:\/\/img.skitch.com\/20090702-q77sif7axcu6f15ardfiy7panx.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>active_scaffold<\/h2>\n<p>See my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/sarahblog\/2009\/07\/getting-started-with-activescaffold\/\">previous post<\/a> for details.  This seems to be the grand-daddy of this genre of plugins and has a very active <a href=\"http:\/\/groups.google.com\/group\/activescaffold\">google group<\/a>.  I liked this plugin when I first tried it, but it hung when I applied it to my real app.  Also, <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jamieflournoy\/status\/2445545932\">@jamieflournoy notes<\/a> that he didn't like the UI for editing related models as much as he did Streamlined.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After my recent ActiveScaffold post, I heard about several newer alternatives from Jaime Flournoy, Mike Gunderloy, and some more web surfing.
