Most internet tools and servers these days will import and export XML data.  This means that it is increasingly easier to do a small amount of work and interoperate with lots of other software.  Where there exists an XML standard for a particular type of data, you can often solve just one part of a problem and rely on off-the-shelf tools to take care of the rest.<\/p>\n<p>After I wrote the last entry on my OPML viewer, it stuck me that most humans (even most techies) have never heard of OPML.  (Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.it\/0100198\/\">Marc Canter<\/a> for telling me about it.)  I&#8217;m not even sure how ubiquitous this format is, but it applied well to the task at hand.  As with most XML formats, it has its own website and I could read all about it on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.opml.org\">opml.org<\/a> and found interesting sample data and software anecdots with a quick google search. Because blogrolling supports OPML export I had an easy data source.  I did need to doctor it up for categories, but it was a great way to get my experimental app working quickly.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;Failing to work with XML, is, in some circles, tantamount to being unpatriotic or antisocial.&#8221; &#8212; JSTL in Action, by Shawn Bayern XML may never catch up to its turn-of-the-millennium hype, but it is a useful standard.
