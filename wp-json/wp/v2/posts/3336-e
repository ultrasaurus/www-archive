I agreed with Rob.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I love delightful motion graphics that make you feel immersed in an alternate space. We&#8217;re even <a href=\"http:\/\/classes.blazingcloud.net\/courses\/show\/30\/interactive-graphics-with-javascript-and-css3\">teaching a class<\/a> on it at Blazing Cloud, since we&#8217;re starting to see what used to be called &#8220;multimedia&#8221; arrive on the web sans plugin. If you&#8217;ve got a Chrome browser, you gotta <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ro.me\">check this out<\/a>.  <\/p>\n<p>However, I believe we can do more with motion than purely entertain. We can use motion graphics to teach, to engage, and illustrate our conclusions. Zach Gemignani describes this well as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.juiceanalytics.com\/writing\/author\/Zach-Gemignani\/\">Wow vs. Ah-ha<\/a> (via <a href=\"http:\/\/flowingdata.com\/2011\/07\/08\/wow-vs-ah-ha-for-data-graphics\/\">FlowingData<\/a>).  We&#8217;re seeing many great examples of motion in human interface design that conveys meaning.  The iPhone uses motion to convey a sense of greater space and to maintain visual persistence when screens change state &#8212; of course, this only works because the device is fast enough that the experience doesn&#8217;t slow down to teach us what it is doing. I&#8217;m excited to see increased use of thoughtful motion graphics in web, as well as mobile applications.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In 1996, I was working at Macromedia, when Rob Burgess took over as CEO.
