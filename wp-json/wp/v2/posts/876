A recent <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/02\/24\/health\/24well.html\">New York Times article<\/a> by Tara Parker-Pope reports that &#8220;play and down time may be as important to a child\u2019s academic experience as reading, science and math, and that regular recess, fitness or nature time can influence behavior, concentration and even grades.&#8221;<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\n&#8230;the brain uses two forms of attention. \u201cDirected\u201d attention allows us to concentrate on work, reading and tests, while \u201cinvoluntary\u201d attention takes over when we\u2019re distracted by things like running water, crying babies, a beautiful view or a pet that crawls onto our lap.<\/p>\n<p>Directed attention is a limited resource. Long hours in front of a computer or studying for a test can leave us feeling fatigued. But spending time in natural settings appears to activate involuntary attention, giving the brain\u2019s directed attention time to rest.\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In addition to the study, publish in Pediatrics, the article quotes Dr. Stuart Brown, the author of the new book <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1583333339?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ultrasaurus-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1583333339\">Play: How It Shapes the Brain, Opens the Imagination, and Invigorates the Soul<\/a><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.assoc-amazon.com\/e\/ir?t=ultrasaurus-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1583333339\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important;margin:0px !important\" \/><br \/>\n.
