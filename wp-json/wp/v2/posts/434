By making our flu estimates available each day, Google Flu Trends may provide an early-warning system for outbreaks of influenza.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;For epidemiologists, this is an exciting development, because early detection of a disease outbreak can reduce the number of people affected. If a new strain of influenza virus emerges under certain conditions, a pandemic could emerge and cause millions of deaths (as happened, for example, in 1918). Our up-to-date influenza estimates may enable public health officials and health professionals to better respond to seasonal epidemics and &#8212; though we hope never to find out &#8212; pandemics.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Google folk, Jeremy Ginsberg, Matthew Mohebbi, Rajan Patel, and  Mark Smolinski, and Larry Brilliant have teamed up with Lynnette Brammer from the CDC and have written an article that has been accepted into the scientific journal <em>Nature<\/em>.
