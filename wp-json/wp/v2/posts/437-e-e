Since I gotta check all all the new video tech, I dove right in.  Hmm&#8230; who do I know who uses a gmail account who will be logged in right now?<\/p>\n<p>So, I open gmail to check out my contacts, of which I have none.  But, lo and behold, I can use my AOL buddy list.  I sign in and ping my friend (name omitted to protect the innocent):<\/p>\n<p>ultrasaurus03 (6:52:12 PM): yt?<br \/>\nfriend (6:53:48 PM): Yes.<br \/>\nfriend (6:53:51 PM): Youre&#8217; okay with this?<br \/>\nfriend (6:53:53 PM): &#8220;Your IM conversation with ultrasaurus03 will be saved in ultrasaurus03&#8217;s IM history in Gmail from now on.  Learn more at http:\/\/x.aim.com\/gmail.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>OK, kindly big brother google is now tracking my every thought.  Not an issue for this experiment, but duly noted.<\/p>\n<p>Friend agrees to participate in my random technology experience.  I tell him to hang on and I choose the video option.  Ack!  now I need to install&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/images\/blog\/google-video-chat\/install.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Good thing I&#8217;m running Windows XP.  It actually takes more than a few seconds to install&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>maybe a minute or so&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>but then I need to restart my browser.<\/p>\n<p>Whew!  I&#8217;m back.  I login to gmail&#8230; and &#8230;<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/images\/blog\/google-video-chat\/not-yet-available.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>oh, gee.  Not only do I need to have XP, but my friend does too.  Time to find another friend.<\/p>\n<p>Ok, now I&#8217;ve pinged another friend (via AIM) who has XP.  He signs up for a gmail account.  We add each other to our buddy lists.  Then he installs the software.  Whew.<\/p>\n<p>Now we&#8217;re ready to chat&#8230;  after one weird interaction (or lack thereof):<br \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/images\/blog\/google-video-chat\/invite.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re actually communicating:<br \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/images\/blog\/google-video-chat\/pic-in-pic.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a bit weird that it doesn&#8217;t seem to know he doesn&#8217;t have a camera &#8212; I really don&#8217;t need a large blank box on my screen while we have an audio conversation, but the quality of the audio is really quite good.  I&#8217;m using the sucky built-in mic on my laptop but it doesn&#8217;t seem to be an issue like it is on some systems.<\/p>\n<p>The official <a href=\"http:\/\/googleblog.blogspot.com\/2008\/11\/talk-face-to-face-right-from-within.html\">Google blog says<\/a> &#8220;Gmail voice and video chat will be rolled out globally over the next day or so for Macs and PCs&#8221; &#8212; that was 3 days ago and no Mac version yet, but it is good to hear it is coming.<\/p>\n<p>Interesting that Google chose to use audio-video technology from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vidyo.com\/\">Vidyo<\/a> rather than the ubiquitous Flash video.  I would guess the decision not to use Flash stemmed from the superior audio conversation experience, since they did go with Flash video for the Google video site.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>InformationWeek reports on google&#8217;s new voice and video chat.
