(For example, I typically test Rails controllers through integration tests rather than unit test.) However, when a class is relied upon as the foundation for my app, unit tests for that class are more valuable than integration tests because they help me find and fix bugs faster than the integration tests.  But I agree that integration tests are essential.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I enjoyed &#8220;strong statements&#8221; in Shannon Behrens&#8217; SF Ruby talk tonight.
