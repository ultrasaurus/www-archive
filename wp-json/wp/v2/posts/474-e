Since I started this weblog in <a href=\"http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20030326155324\/http:\/\/ultrasaurus.com\/\">2003<\/a> with Movable Type 2.63, I have upgraded it every year or two and periodically added do-dads and code snippets.  Sometimes it is easier to start fresh than to fix what&#8217;s there.<\/p>\n<p>This morning I decided to completely recreate this blog and the comment system does seem to work.  If you have posted a comment in the last couple of years I made you a trusted commenter.  If you are a new friend (or one of my old friends who reads this and then never says anything), the next time you comment I will make you trusted. If you are a trusted commenter, then comments will be posted immediately.  If the new MT is better at spam prevention, then maybe I&#8217;ll just let anyone comment, but I had over 7000 spam comments that I just deleted so it has been a bit of a problem.<\/p>\n<p>Please post a comment to help me test.  Feel free to give me any feedback on blog design. I plan to bring back in elements of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/backup-2009-01-03\/\">old design<\/a> after ensuring that the functionality is working.  Do folks like the new three-column layout or is it too cluttered? Should I post an image of me with my new purple hair?<\/p>\n<p>The tag cloud is obviously broken.  I&#8217;ll tackle that next.  Please let me know if you see anything else funky.<\/p>\n<p>[Update: moved to WordPress and the lovely thematic theme.]<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/lou\/1353616104\/\"><img src=\"http:\/\/farm2.static.flickr.com\/1329\/1353616104_fdcbc9f7d0.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;ve been periodically trying to fix comments on this weblog with no luck.
