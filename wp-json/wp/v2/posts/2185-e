It also let you look up someone&#8217;s name who you ought to know, but had forgotten. <\/p>\n<p>This was the first time I attended RubyConf. I have been programming in Ruby for almost a year and through organizing <a href=\"http:\/\/sfrubyworkshops.com\/\">outreach workshops<\/a> and other <a href=\"http:\/\/railsbridge.org\/\">RailsBridge<\/a> activities, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/sfruby\/\">SF Ruby<\/a>, and adventures in the twitterverse and blogosphere, I knew (and knew of) quite a few Rubyists.  <\/p>\n<p>The best part of RubyConf was meeting people who I had previously known only virtually &#8212; from people whose blogs or books I had read, to people whose software I had worked with, to those with whom I have had ephemeral conversations with via twitter or fleeting working relationships via RailsBridge. I found people to be very friendly and outgoing.  More so than at any other conference I have attended, people would just start talking to me in the hallway and I found it easy to join people for lunch or beers.  I&#8217;m sure it helped to be a speaker, but I have been a speaker at other conferences and been well-known in other communities which didn&#8217;t have the same feeling of being welcomed as a new friend.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some highlights:<\/p>\n<p>I was impressed by Jim Meier who rounded up a group of folks who didn&#8217;t all know each other for Thursday dinner at Steelhead Brewery. I got to meet <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/paul_brannan\">Paul Brannan<\/a>, a long-time Rubyist who is one of four people to have attended every RubyConf.  Sadly, for the other folks I met that evening, my poken failed me.  I got an awesome introduction to Erlang from a new friend, whose name I can&#8217;t place and whose vcard was not recorded in my poken.  <\/p>\n<p>Lunch with <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/averyj\">James Avery<\/a>, Nathanial Talbot of <a href=\"http:\/\/terralien.com\/\">Terralien<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jimweirich\">Jim Weirich<\/a>, creator of xmlbuilder and rake, who warmly participated in my Ruby word game: a good use of the word &#8220;closure&#8221; in a sentence and related challenges.  Jim came up with: &#8220;Objects may be used to implement closures; and closures may be used to implement objects.&#8221; This not only led to intriguing lunchtime conversation, but also to fun <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mightyverse.com\/media\/e426e144-80bc-4394-837c-b5461da4bb82\">Japanese translation<\/a> (more on that later, after all of the phrases are posted!).<\/p>\n<p>Caleb Clausen spontaneously invited me to a recap of his presentation, <a href=\"http:\/\/rubyconf.org\/talks\/84-towards-a-ruby-compiler\">Toward a Ruby Compiler<\/a>, which he was giving to Laurent (of MacRuby) during a break.<\/p>\n<p>I had some nice real-time conversation with <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/webandy\">Andy Atkinson<\/a> who I has previously only known thru twitter.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.davidchelimsky.net\/\">David Chilimnsky<\/a> of RSpec fame, whose book I have enjoyed, had been following my adventures in test-first-teaching with RSpec.  I suppose I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised but the internet is a funny place where you never know who is really reading the bits of information that you send off into the ether. <\/p>\n<p>I closed the conference by attending <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#search?q=larkconf\">larkconf<\/a>, where <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/l4rk\">l4rk<\/a> asked people who joined the circle of beer-drinkers to share their dream.  That little kumbaya moment had the unexpected effect of making it just a tiny bit less awkward to be the only woman approaching a crowd of a dozen or so guys at a bar.  I talking with <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/briandoll\">Brian Doll<\/a> about the SFRuby community and <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/bonkydog\">Brian Jenkins<\/a> about interactive fiction and <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/imf\">Ian McFarland<\/a> about language.<\/p>\n<p>Overall the conference for me was characterized by informal conversation with famous, lesser known and novice Rubyists.  It was kind of sad that more folks could not attend, but I really enjoyed the small scale of the gathering.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>RubyConf had a most excellent &#8220;hallway track.&#8221; This was augmented by the fabulous Poken, which allowed you to &#8220;high-four&#8221; someone who you met and avoid rummaging around for business cards.
