The artifacts and tools that we create have power and purpose. In our modern world, open data and open source software can be powerful forces that create positive impact. With open source software, freely distributed libraries and applications influence behavior, affecting properties of the systems that rule our lives. By making certain things easy for other software developers, one small piece of code can have outsize effects on unrelated commercial software. Open and easily accessible datasets can create positive economic impact that can be more evenly distributed than investments of capital.<\/p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t know the story, or if it has been a while, you can catch up on the lore, reading <a href=\"http:\/\/tolkiengateway.net\/wiki\/Ring_Verse\">Tolkien Gateway&#8217;s background on the Ring Verse<\/a> or listen to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4s59oDfDoI8\">Tolkien reading the Ring Verse<\/a> on YouTube.<\/p>\n<h2>Tolkien&#8217;s reflection on power<\/h2>\n<p>Tolkien&#8217;s ring mythology aptly illustrates that to exercise power, one must give it away (and risk losing it), which he explains in one of his letters. Dr. Rhona Beare&#8217;s correspondence led Tolkien to elaborate on the rings of power as a mythical representation of power or, in his words, <em>potency<\/em>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The Ring of Sauron is only one of the various mythical treatments of the placing of one&#8217;s life, or power, in some external object, which is thus exposed to capture or destruction with disastrous results to oneself&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>  a mythical way of representing the truth that <em>potency<\/em> (or<br \/>\n  perhaps rather <em>potentiality<\/em>) if it is to be exercised, and produce results, has to be externalised and so as it were passed, to a greater or less degree, out of one\u2019s direct control. A man who wishes to exert<br \/>\n  &#8216;power&#8217; must have subjects, who are not himself. But he then depends on them.<br \/>\n  &#8212; 14 October 1958 <a href=\"#1\">[1]<\/a>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Whether it is capital investment, the intellectual property of source code, knowledge that you have collected as data or a small golden ring, you can amplify your power by giving it away, but then you must rely on others. Like Frodo, we can all exercise free will in deciding what to do with the power we are given. Destroy the ring, keep the elven chain mail shirt, go adventuring or enjoy our home in the shire. We decide.<\/p>\n<p><!---\n> think of the difference between cashflow and capital. If all you have is cashflow \u2013 money which you spend as soon as you earn it \u2013 then any interruption leaves you helpless. It doesn\u2019t matter how rich you were up until that point.\n\n> However, if you save a portion of your income, then you accumulate capital. And that gives you options \u2013 not only a reserve to fall back on, but also a means of boosting one\u2019s own economic power and of acquiring control over that of others.\n\nThe article draws an analogy to the Lord of the Rings. When Sauron of Mordor created the One Ring, it was an investment of power, akin to saving capital. At first seemingly foolish since that power could be lost, except that whoever found it would be drawn to use that power in the ways of Sauron and then could be seen by him.\n\n> in addition to the One Ring, 19 subsidiary \u2018Rings of Power\u2019 were created and distributed among the movers-and-shakers of Middle Earth. The recipients thought they were getting a free gift; in reality they were plugging themselves into a network under the ultimate control of the One Ring, which Sauron retained for himself.\n\nThe article suggests that a parallel from our own world: a networked service where its benefits appear to be free, yet our participation amplifies its power, ultimately repaying the \u2018generosity\u2019 of those who control it.  This references a common business model today, that is applied on a much bigger scale than Facebook.\n\n> Though we\u2019re not forced by law to use social media, the technology is so enmeshed in the way we live that it\u2019s getting harder to do without it. And that\u2019s without taking into account its addictive qualities. Even when we don\u2019t actually need it, we wants it. Yesss, we do, my precious. Now, where did I put my phone?\n\nvia [@skmurphy tweet](\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/skmurphy\/status\/1116846407111983105)\n--><br \/>\n[<a name=\"1\">1<\/a>] originally published in a <a href=\"http:\/\/tolkiengateway.net\/wiki\/J.R.R._Tolkien%27s_Letters_to_Rhona_Beare\">booklet<\/a>, later in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/2327.The_Letters_of_J_R_R_Tolkien\">The Letters of J.R.R.
