Both languages are driven by procedural code.  Objects are created in a series of statements.  Everything has a name, even temporary variables, loop iterators, and transient objects that are created to support other objects.  I generally have a hatful of conventions which spares me from having to think too much about unimportant names.<\/p>\n<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been working with a declarative object-oriented language (LZX from Laszlo Systems).   Objects are created within an XML hierarchy.  Many objects that appear on the screen or control other objects are anonymous.  I only create names for objects when I need to reference them.  It turns out that most objects don&#8217;t need names.<\/p>\n<p>Since I have gotten used to this unusual declarative style of programming I have found it refreshingly easy to whip up a graphical user interface.  Its not that I ever thought that Javascript or even C++ was that hard, despite some cumbersome or awkward aspects of each language.  Sometimes, it can be challenging to create software.  I didn&#8217;t ascribe that difficulty to the language itself, but rather to the solving of a particular problem.<\/p>\n<p>LZX allows you to mix in Javascript.  Where it is more appropriate to solve a problem with procedural code, you can define methods or include a snippet of Javascript to handle an event.  Recently I solved a few problems by writing quite a bit of Javascript.  I reflected on why it feels so much easier to declare a program with XML tags, depite the seemingly verbose syntax.  Part of the ease of declarative XML is that common patterns are encapsulated in tags, but I think there is more to it than that.  It seems that there is a certain intellectual overhead in creating even boilerplate names for transient variables.   For me this was an unexpected observation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I often think about programming as an exercise in naming.
