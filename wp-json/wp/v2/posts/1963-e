I joined his regular Sunday study group as a TA, where I had fun teaching about <a href=\"http:\/\/adam.blog.heroku.com\/past\/2007\/12\/20\/nested_resources_in_rails_2\/\">nested routes<\/a>, debugging <a href=\"http:\/\/apidock.com\/rails\/ActionView\/Helpers\/FormOptionsHelper\/collection_select\">collection_select<\/a>, and spreading the word about <a href=\"http:\/\/guides.rubyonrails.org\/2_3_release_notes.html#nested-attributes\">nested attributes<\/a>.\u00a0 After the class, a few students stayed late and joined me as I learned from Alex about his approach to teaching, which he calls test-driven teaching (TDT).\u00a0 He did this intially in teaching java and more recently teaching Ruby.\u00a0 For homework assignments he would give student tests and then they would write the code to make them pass.\u00a0 This is one of those ideas that I hadn&#8217;t thought of, but as soon as he told me about it, the idea seemed an obvious way to teach.\u00a0 What beter way to specify an assignment that to provide a test?<\/p>\n<p>What I&#8217;d ike to do for the class is to start with TDT and then shift to TDD once the students are familiar enough with the Ruby syntax and the Rails object model.\u00a0 It is perhaps aggressive for 6 2-hour classes, but with homework assignments between classes and students who are already programmers, it seems like it could fit into the time frame.<\/p>\n<p>My first challenge is to figure out what are the essential Ruby language constructs that people need to know for writing Rails applications, what would be good exercises for learning those skills, and then write the tests that would require that code to be written.\u00a0 It feels like a little bit &#8216;o Ruby jeopardy.\u00a0 Alex has promised to meet with me again to brainstorm and I&#8217;ll publish what we come up with, but if you are reading this and you write Rails applications, I would love your feedback on what are the essential Ruby skills for a Rails engineer (plus any Ruby, Rails or TDD teaching tips would be welcome).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In preparing to teach a new class, Ruby on Rails Fundamentals, I felt strongly that I wanted to teach test-driven development (TDD).\u00a0 Initially my motivation was that I found it hard to learn TDD when I learned Rails.\u00a0 I found little instructional material on the web and the variety of test frameworks was a bit&hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/2009\/08\/test-driven-teaching\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":84,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1963"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/84"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1963"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1963\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1963"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1963"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1963"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
