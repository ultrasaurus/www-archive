Developing in the open creates an unprecedented level of transparency and offers new potential to engage members of the public in the operation of our democracy.<\/p>\n<p>Before that time, most projects from the Presidential Innovation Fellows and the new 18F team were open source, but each project required specific sign off by agency leaders for it to be open.  Creating a policy dramatically streamlined this sign-off process. Working in the open saves time and money:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>streamlines communication<\/li>\n<li>increases code reuse<\/li>\n<li>reduces vendor lock-in<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In 2013, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2013\/05\/09\/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government-\">Open Data Executive Order<\/a> set the stage for this work.  By making it so that open data was the default expectation, it means that thousands of civil servants may provide open data as part of their process, without needing to get permission for each individual data set to be published.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s great to see industry press starting to take notice of this transformation happening inside the US Government.
