I went to a private school and generally lived a life of privilege. Our house was smaller than the one outside of Boston, and we didn&#8217;t have air-conditioning or a fancy compound like other members of the British-American club where we went swimming. My brother and I could go down to the corner store and buy firecrackers, and we would go across the street to a soccer field and find spots in the nearby trees where we could blow up piles of sticks.  From there we could see where some folks lived: shacks with no running water, tin roofs, and painfully thin children.<\/p>\n<p>In fifth grade, I&#8217;m sure I had no real idea of what was happening, but I knew I had privilege.
