There are way too many restaurants in San Francisco, and too many matches to whatever search I could come up with about good places to eat near the airport.  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fluther.com\">Fluther<\/a> solved my <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fluther.com\/disc\/1496\/whats-that-restaurant-in-san-francisco-where-you-can-eat-inside\/?utm_source=asked_notify&amp;utm_medium=email\">dilemma <\/a> in two days.<\/p>\n<p>I had just checked back into fluther which has grown into quite a nice site.  (I got an early peek at it last year, but it officially launched last week with an already thriving community.)  I had asked &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.fluther.com\/disc\/162\/why-do-we-use-the-letter-g-for-a-j-sound\/\">Why do we use the letter &#8216;g&#8217; for a &#8216;j&#8217; sound?<\/a>&#8221;  The answers were not as authoritative as my research into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/sarahblog\/archives\/000051.html\">the history of the letter &#8216;c&#8217;<\/a> where I sought answers from <a href=\"http:\/\/linguistlist.org\/ask-ling\/index.html\">professional linguists<\/a>; however, if I&#8217;m fine with an answer as authoritative as one from a hallway conversation (perfect for my restaurant question), then fluther is a good solution.<\/p>\n<p>The site has some nice features. It tracks my questions and answers and even recommends questions for me to answer.  I wonder how it comes up with those (which aren&#8217;t about linguistics or restaurants with planes).  It&#8217;s also good to see that they&#8217;ve started a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fluther.com\/blog\/\">blog<\/a>, which really ought to have an entry about the origin of the name and maybe explain why they are interested in jellyfish photos.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.fluther.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2007\/06\/jellyfish1.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For a few years, I&#8217;ve been trying to remember the name of this restaurant I went to ten years ago or so.
