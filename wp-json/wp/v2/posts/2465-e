I&#8217;ve reflected on what works well and experimented with curriculum and teaching style modifications for the sections where students struggled.  I&#8217;ve found a sequence which works very effectively.  I believe it could be applied to teaching any programming language, and perhaps to teaching anything.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Conceptual Overview<\/strong> A presentation of the concept: why it is important, what it can do, how it works. How  it fits into the bigger picture (if applicable). Pictures and diagrams are great here.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Experimentation (Play)<\/strong> My goal in this section is to create a feeling of play&#8230; at best, with grown-ups, I think I&#8217;ve achieved a sense of experimentation or, perhaps, what the Talent Code calls &#8220;deep practice&#8221; <\/li>\n<li><strong>Demonstration of a Real-World Example<\/strong> A live coding demonstration that solves a real problem.  I often use this as an opportunity to test-drive the example, which illustrates the concept from two angles: the test (expectation) and implementation.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Simple hands-on exercise<\/strong> Test first teaching examples where the student is given a test that fails and they have to apply what they just learned to write code and make the test pass.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This was the context of my talk tonight at the <a href=\"http:\/\/ruby.meetup.com\/81\/calendar\/12145157\/\">East Bay Ruby Meetup<\/a>.
