I&#8217;ve got some outlier followers with a crazy number of followers themselves, the max is SamsungMobile with 10,592,003 followers.  Twitter also claims that HillaryClinton is following me, but her account makes it seem like there are only 16 people she&#8217;s following &#8212; do famous people get to follow people in secret?  or was this some weird glitch in the Twitter API<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/Screen-Shot-2015-05-11-at-2.49.02-AM.png\" alt=\"Twitter Stats\" width=\"427\" height=\"54\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5536\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/Screen-Shot-2015-05-11-at-2.49.02-AM.png 427w, https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/Screen-Shot-2015-05-11-at-2.49.02-AM-300x38.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As of this writing the Twitter UI tells me I have 7,058 followers,<br \/>\nbut I seem to have been able to get 7,481 from the API.<\/p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, my followers have a relatively low median number of followers (281) with a large standard deviation (157,367).
