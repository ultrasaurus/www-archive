It seems to be the way that a lot of projects are moving, especially for rails and open source projects; besides, all the kids are doing it, so I figured I would follow the trend.  In addition to using it pretty simply for small projects, I&#8217;m moving a project from subversion to git, which turn out to be a little bumpy, so I thought I would share.<\/p>\n<p>I started with these awesomely simple instructions <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplisticcomplexity.com\/2008\/03\/05\/cleanly-migrate-your-subversion-repository-to-a-git-repository\/\">to cleanly migrate your subversion repository<\/a> with the addition of a handy script to automatically <a href=\"http:\/\/technicalpickles.com\/posts\/creating-a-svn-authorsfile-when-migrating-from-subversion-to-git\">create an svn.authors file<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This all seemed to go well, until we tried to run the code and learned that svn-git failed to fetch a directory!  svn-git really ought to warn you somehow that it doesn&#8217;t support fetching externals.  This I learned by noticing that the svn log had no checkins of those files and then saw when I did a clean svn checkout that it was fetching externals for the vendor\/plugins directory.  Of course that makes a lot of sense, but I didn&#8217;t set up the svn so I didn&#8217;t know.  Then I spent some time wandering through the wilderness of blogs and mailing lists learning about svn externals and git submodules, and I found some interesting clues:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/kerneltrap.org\/mailarchive\/git\/2007\/5\/1\/245002\">tracking ffmpeg in svn as a git submodule<\/a> with fancy instructions on how to make branches of those projects as submodules that can be committed to <\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/panthersoftware.com\/articles\/view\/3\/svn-s-svn-externals-to-git-s-submodule-for-rails-plugins\">svn externals to git submodules<\/a> which lists 5 options with a follow-up article on <a href=\"http:\/\/panthersoftware.com\/articles\/view\/4\/git-svn-dcommit-workaround-for-git-submodules\">using sub-projects and git-rails-plugins<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>After all of that, I stepped back and thought about what I actually needed for this project.  We&#8217;re currently at 2.0.2 and planning to upgrade to the the latest, and it turns out that all of the plugins that we&#8217;re currently tracking on subversion have moved their latest versions to git.  So, I decided to just pull in the vendor\/plugins directory verbatim, detaching the external reference, and move to git submodules as we upgrade.  What I really wanted to do, but didn&#8217;t see how to, was to reference the plugin code as an http URL and keep as a submodule, so that I would have a handy reference to source location and revision.<\/p>\n<pre>\n$mkdir project-tmp\n$cd project-tmp\/\n$git-svn init svn:\/\/myserver\/project\/trunk\n$git config svn.authorsfile ..\/svn-users.txt\n$git-svn fetch\n    :\nChecked out HEAD:\n  svn:\/\/myserver\/project\/trunk r999\n\n$cd vendor\n$svn co svn:\/\/whatever.com\/myproject\/trunk\/vendor\/plugins\n$cd plugins\n$rm -rf .svn  \n$git add .\n\n$cd ..\n$git clone project-tmp project\n$rm -rf project-tmp\n<\/pre>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;ve been learning git lately and it seems much easier to use than subversion for branching and merging, but I still have yet to become adept at looking at a file history.
