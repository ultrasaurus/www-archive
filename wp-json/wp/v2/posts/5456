Pale skin, rosy cheeks and a wide smile can smooth the way to a comfortable place.  I was never hungry, always had books to read when I was little, and later computers and then laptops.  Nevertheless, fear and suffering has touched my life in a way that motivates me to do what I can to act as an ally and bring to light injustice when I see it.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s much easier to make big, bold gestures than it is to do the right thing at the right moment.  I don\u2019t always know what to do, but I thought I would write down some ideas of how we might go about being better allies.  I\u2019d love to hear ideas from other people too.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name your heroes \u2014 seriously make a list of your top ten.  If they are mostly one race, class or gender, find some more heroes.\n<\/li>\n<li>If you can\u2019t quickly think of three black people in your profession who you admire, think about making some new friends, and in the meantime, find them in the press.  (Hint: you might actually have to look hard, but it\u2019s not that they aren\u2019t there, they\u2019re just less written about)  Try the same thought experiment for Latinos or Latinas, Native Americans, or other folks who are under-represented in your peer group or leadership.\n<\/li>\n<li>If someone tells you that something you said sounded racist, apologize and thank them for telling you.  (Don\u2019t get defensive.  Don\u2019t tell them they took it the wrong way.  If you didn\u2019t mean to be racist, think about how you could say it differently next time so there would be no shadow of a doubt.)\n<\/li>\n<li>If you hear something that sounds racist, call them out on it.  Don\u2019t wait for the person of color in the room to say something, or ask them if it offended them.  You can be offended all by yourself.\n<\/li>\n<li>When you are asked who should be invited to a meeting, think about inviting someone who is black, latino, and whatever other races or cultures are under-represented.\n<\/li>\n<li>If you work in a homogeneous environment, recruit for diversity.  If your company can\u2019t or won\u2019t recruit diverse talent, think about working somewhere else.\n<\/li>\n<li>If someone invites you to speak at an event and there are no people of color on the speaker list, suggest someone else.  (If you can\u2019t think of someone who would be a great speaker in your stead, do some research and find a few.)\n<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t assume you understand someone else\u2019s experience.  No matter what color you think they are.  Don\u2019t assume race or culture, based on skin color.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I am a child of privilege.
