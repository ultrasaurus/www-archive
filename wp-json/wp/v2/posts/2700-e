In addition to allowing you to pan and zoom with natural gestures, you can clip sections of the panorama by holding down two fingers at the corners of the area you want to clip.\u00a0 You can can then keep that section for comparison with another part of the panorama and if you toss it to the top of the surface, it will appear on the large presentation screen.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/img.skitch.com\/20100530-pkcp2cmf7dys2b57td5mfgbdqm.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The Surface includes 5 cameras (mounted under the surface) and computer vision technology which detect objects placed on the surface.  This allowed the student programmers to create a magnifying glass effect when two physical objects that look like small inkwells are placed on the surface.  The Surface can also detect a hand before it touches the screen, and I found it effective that there was hover feedback where the area that I was about to touch was highlighted.<\/p>\n<p>One detail that I enjoyed was the use of a pie menu to provide a selection of controls.  The lines connecting the options were animated to provide a visual cue that you need to slide your finger along the surface to select an option.<br \/>\n<img src=\"http:\/\/img.skitch.com\/20100530-rh4k8m7dbc15x3w1yre2mhhnkq.png\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>\n(I found more photos and details about the user interface features on <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/b\/surface\/archive\/2010\/04\/27\/experience-the-garibaldi-panorama-on-surface.aspx\">Eric Havir&#8217;s blog<\/a>.)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Garibaldi Project has created a way for scholars to interact with a work of art that is too fragile and too large for routine study.\u00a0 Yesterday, I sat in on a forum presentation of this Brown University project.\u00a0 The project is a collaboration with Microsoft Research and the British Library, using a Microsoft Surface&hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/2010\/05\/interactive-multi-touch-scholarship\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":84,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2700"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/84"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2700"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2700\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2700"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2700"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2700"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
