That is what my smtp server listens on<br \/>\n<strong>Sarah<\/strong>: I can use the comcast one with a username\/password, but I won&#8217;t be able to use that when I&#8217;m not at home<br \/>\n<strong>Gillema<\/strong>: Sarah, you may not use tb25 for this is more open to any viruses that may harm on your computer.<br \/>\n<strong>Sarah<\/strong>: I don&#8217;t accept incoming connections on 25, so my computer is not vulnerable<br \/>\n<strong>Sarah<\/strong>: Do you have any evidence of infection?<br \/>\n<strong>Sarah<\/strong>: I run two macs and a Windows machine where the anti-virus is typically kept up to date by my work IT department<br \/>\n<strong>Gillema<\/strong>: I see. May I ask what third party email client are you using? Is it outlook express or outlook2003?<br \/>\n<strong>Sarah<\/strong>: Apple Mail on the Macs and Thunderbird on Windows (or web mail)<br \/>\n<strong>Gillema<\/strong>: I see. Thank you for the information.<br \/>\n<strong>Gillema<\/strong>: So, Sarah! In using the TB25, are you able to send a message on both of your third party email clients?<br \/>\n<strong>Sarah<\/strong>: sending&#8230;<br \/>\n<strong>Sarah<\/strong>: that worked, you unblocked it?<br \/>\n<strong>Gillema<\/strong>: Yes.

Will there be anything else I can help you today?<br \/>\n<strong>Sarah<\/strong>: Yes, issue resolved.\u00a0 Thank you very much<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I was so shocked that Comcast was actually willing and able to resove my problem without a prolonged interaction with managerial escalataion that I exclaimed aloud to my family and a funny conversation ensued<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Mommy<\/strong>: I can&#8217;t believe it.\u00a0 Comcast actually opened the port.<br \/>\n<strong>Son<\/strong>: What&#8217;s a port?<br \/>\n<strong>Daddy<\/strong>: It&#8217;s a harbor or bay where ships can dock.\u00a0 And the Comcast navy was blocking our ships from getting out of the harbor.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Son<\/strong>: I know *that* but really, what&#8217;s a port?<br \/>\n<strong>Mommy<\/strong>: you know how a lot of computer words are named after real world things, like the mouse, the web&#8230;<br \/>\n<strong>Son<\/strong>: spiders?<br \/>\n<em>[Intended as a joke, it of course led to a small digression on what a spider is &#8212; the computer program not the arachnid<\/em>]<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mommy<\/strong>: a port is a place (not a physical place, but rather a number) that is part of the network connection so multiple programs can communicate on the same time.\u00a0 Like for example, port 80 is for the Web&#8230;<br \/>\n<strong>Son<\/strong>: why port 80?
