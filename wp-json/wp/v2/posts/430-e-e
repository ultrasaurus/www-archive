She told wonderful stories about what it was like to be one of the first programmers, after she had worked on the job as a &#8220;computer&#8221; calculating ballistic tables for the war effort.  She was one of 6 women who were chosen to program the ENIAC.  The machine had just been built and the women had to figure out how to make it calculate a trajectory by connecting wires and setting its 3000 switches.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/eniacprogrammers.org\/images\/kk-eniac2-400-fw.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Following her experience programming the ENIAC, she went to work at Eckert &amp; Mauchley Corporation.  She&#8217;s captured some of the tales in an essay that describes the company as a &#8220;Technical Camelot&#8221;.  Well-worth reading, but I can&#8217;t find it online.  They handed out paper copies at the event.<\/p>\n<p>It was amazing to hear her stories live and in person.  Kathryn Kleiman has filmed all of the <a href=\"http:\/\/eniacprogrammers.org\/\">ENIAC programmers<\/a> and currently raising funds for a full-length documentary.  You can make a personal <a href=\"http:\/\/eniacprogrammers.org\/donate.html\">donation<\/a> or, even better, see if your company would be interested in a corporate sponsorship.  If you can make an introduction, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/emailme.php\">let me know<\/a>, since I&#8217;ve been informally helping Kathy with bay area fundraising.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last week I heard Jean Jennings Bartik speak at the Computer History Museum.
