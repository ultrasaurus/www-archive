The ratio seems likely to decline even further in future years. These days, only about 15% of undergraduate computer science degrees at major universities go to women.&#8221;  In the mid-80&#8217;s women received over 40% of CS degrees and it looked like we were going to get to 50-50, but by 1990 it had declined to 18% and apparently is still declining.<\/p>\n<p>I find the gender-angle on these stories interesting and personally relevant; however, I find it somewhat sad that honoring her accomplishments seems to be eclipsed by the story of her gender.
