We created a store, but chose to sell three varieties of pots: tea pots, garden pots and cooking pots.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mylaszlo.com\/lps-v1\/pablo\/store\/store.lzx\">Pot Store<\/a> is a work-in-progress.  It needs some attention to the design to clarify navigation.  The graphical elements are pimitive and it is not a fully functioning store.  However, it was a great learning experience and employs some interesting user interface ideas.<\/p>\n<p>* The subtotal updates as you buy, with a small motion to draw the user&#8217;s attention.  You can see a summary of what&#8217;s in your shopping cart with rollover, without losing the context of the catalog view.<\/p>\n<p>* The catalog layout is an example of a continuous user experience.  You can get product details without losing context.  (I consider it a bug that sometimes teapots fly across the screen.  They should all move smoothly out of the way to a nearby spot.)<\/p>\n<p>* Shipping\/billing Address in the checkout section conserves real-estate and minimizes screen (and brain) clutter by only showing the fields that you need.  (click &#8220;ship to a different address&#8221; checkbox)<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve written up some details on my experience of the development process&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><br \/>\nDay 1: Plan the project<br \/>\nWe created an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mylaszlo.com\/lps-v1\/pablo\/store\/mockup.lzx\">interactive spec<\/a> in LZX.  There are 3 main sections.<br \/>\nCatalog (you can click to cycle thru 3 pictures in the mockup)<br \/>\n&#8211; feature product view, one from each category<br \/>\n&#8211; broswe one category<br \/>\n&#8211; product details<br \/>\nShopping Cart<br \/>\n&#8211; subtotal displayed when cart is closed, pop-up summary on rollover<br \/>\n&#8211; cart would allow you to change quantity, delete items<br \/>\nCheckout<br \/>\n&#8211; fill out name &amp; paymeny info<br \/>\n&#8211; ship to different address (checkbox works in mockup)<\/p>\n<p>We split the project into three parts.  I would develop a layout for the catalog view;  Pablo would create the shopping cart; and Yossie would create a simple database and the checkout process.<\/p>\n<p>Day 2:<br \/>\nWe agreed on what queries we wanted from the database.  Yossie created a simple MySQL database and some perl scripts that made the appropriate queries.  I found 15 teapot pictures and descriptions.  Pablo added the cool rollover subtotal feature to the spec.  We each started on our parts.<\/p>\n<p>I had never written a layout before, so I read the docs and looked at the code for simple layout and wrapping layout.  I created some simple test files.<\/p>\n<p>Day 3: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mylaszlo.com\/lps-v1\/pablo\/store\/layout\/testlayout.lzx\">layout motion test <\/a><br \/>\nI modified wrappinglayout to create my new layout, which would show the grid of teapot images. When the user clicked on a teapot, details would be displayed.  The transition between views was a zoom, where te other images would shrink to make room.  This was much easier than I expected and fun to write.<\/p>\n<p>Day 4:<br \/>\nAfter the layout was working with colored squares, I integrated the image data from the server.  Next I needed to integrate the catalog layout into the store app.  Pablo had done a nice job of creating a &#8220;basket&#8221; object, so I could easily call &#8220;basket.addItem&#8221; to hook up the &#8220;buy&#8221; button in the catalog view.<\/p>\n<p>Summary:<br \/>\nPablo &amp; Yossie worked on the app for a few more days.  Overall I felt we accomplished a lot in a week, especially given that Yossie and Pablo were learning LZX during the development process.   It&#8217;s a bit scary to post something so raw and unfinished, but we hope that in doing so other folks can learn from our process.<\/p>\n<p>As part of the development team for the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.laszlosystems.com\">Laszlo Presentation Server<\/a>, I believe it is essential that we experiment with using our software as web app developers.  In creating a platform for rich internet applications, we need to develop not only the architectural design patterns of how to hook up data and views, client and server, ui to back-end logic, but also the visual and interactive design patterns that could led to a more usable web.<\/p>\n<p>Feedback and questions are welcome, as always.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I recently spent some time with LZX developing a prototype app. I thought it would be interesting to write up how we approached the problem and show some of the results that are now posted on mylaszlo.com.
