But visualizations, like statistics can lie.<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;In fact, where the US gets its oil is almost completely irrelevant. The oil market is a world market. The transportation costs are startlingly small but-all things being equal-it&#8217;s easier to get oil from countries that are near you (and hard to get it from countries you don&#8217;t trade with).<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The &#8216;dangerous disconnect&#8217; between American perception&#8211;the US is dependent on Middle Eastern oil&#8211;and the reality&#8211;we get a lot of our oil from Canada&#8211;is actually misunderstanding that is *healthier* than the misunderstanding the chart might lead one to take.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Reading the chart one might imagine that, if the Middle East were plunged into a giant multi-state war, we&#8217;d be basically fine. Of course, unless the United States invaded Canada-and Africa, yay!-and commandeered all the oil for US consumption, we&#8217;d be in the grip of massive undersupply and a resulting rise in the price of oil.<br \/>\nIt&#8217;s also worth saying that reserve numbers have all sorts of spin on them&#8230;\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Personally, I think the graphs help illustrate the conversation.  Your mind doesn&#8217;t have to do a double-step between a list of numbers and the narrative that discusses them.  Graphing statistics helps tell a story, but as Tim says it is only part of the story.  We need to fill in the causal effects and the consequence, and in doing so, draw conclusions and learn.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jon Udell writes about visual numeracy, introducing a new graph to continue the conversation about where the US gets its oil.
