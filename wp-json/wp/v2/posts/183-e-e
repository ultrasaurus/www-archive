A piece of software has not had such an effect on what I do with my computer since <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sixapart.com\/movabletype\/\">Movable Type<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I must be the only sofware engineer in the world who does not have their own personal mp3 collection.  I love music, but I&#8217;m not terribly organized (anyone who knows me can confirm the typical state of my desktop, both real and virtual).  Aside from having an historic aversion to sorting and organizing, I have a specific challenge with music.  I don&#8217;t have a good memory for it.  I can remember arcane technical detail from my software development experience of the early 1990&#8217;s; however, I can&#8217;t recall many of the bands I heard play at Lupo&#8217;s or the Living Room, let alone albums or song titles.  It is hard to connect what I am in the mood for with an array of album covers or song titles.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/images\/blog\/pandora\/pandora-stations.gif\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Pandora lets me chose one song or artist and then it creates a perpetual play list of songs I might like, and most of the time it is right on target.  The application grew out of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pandora.com\/mgp.shtml\">Music Genome Project<\/a> which sought to &#8220;capture the essence of music at the most fundamental level,&#8221; and then proceeded to catalog their findings in what must be a gigantic database.  Pandora makes this database available to me without searching.  With only the barest of a suggestion from me, it has an idea of what I might like.  Of course, as these folks know better than I, offering up a song or an artist is no small suggestion of my taste in music.  A single song has a number of qualities that indicate what I&#8217;m into.<\/p>\n<p>It is no random chance that I found Pandora, since they use <a href=\"http:\/\/www.openlaszlo.org\">OpenLaszlo<\/a> as a development platform.  It&#8217;s always nice when <a href=\"http:\/\/tomconrad.blogspot.com\/2005\/08\/pandora-and-openlaszlo.html\">someone<\/a> uses your tech to create something wonderful.  It&#8217;s at the heart of why I write software.  Seeing Pandora was particularly cool, since they really understand what we call the &#8220;cinemtatic user experience&#8221; or, as we say &#8217;round the office, what it takes takes to make an application Laszlo-riffic.  I don&#8217;t intend to take any credit away from the Pandora folks.  While our platform enables beautiful design and makes it possible to build a fluid and intuitive interface, great design doesn&#8217;t happen automatically.  Great design takes inspiration, insight, thoughtfulness, and most importantly, people who care about it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;ve been listening to Pandora for about a week and I love it.
