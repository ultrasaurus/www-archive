A couple months ago, students all across the country were invited to make short films about the technology in their classrooms or how they imagined their classrooms could use tech.  The results are quite amazing.  Of over 2500 submissions, 16 were selected and the kids were invited to the White House to see the whole festival in person.  The event was kicked off by seventeen-year-old Shelly Ortiz, of Phoenix, who introduced President Obama.  Later Neil deGrasse Tyson and other science and popular media celebs introduced film categories.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that great film making is one of the highest forms of applied critical thinking, problem solving ability, and communication skills.  I would love to see this kind of challenge emulated by governors in every state or mayors of major cities.  We need to inspire our kids to surpass us in their creativity and use of technology.<\/p>\n<p>Here are my favorites:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=awHdAr_n1dk\">Double Time<\/a>.
