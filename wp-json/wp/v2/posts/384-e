He reported a refreshing perspective about the choice between Flash and Ajax on websites today: you quite possibly need both.  He made the analogy to having a hammer and a saw &#8212; you need both to build a house.  (By the way if you haven&#8217;t checked out slideshare is is way cool.

I find it depends what you are doing &#8212; raw script execution and http requests are much slower than the browser, but you can bundle up a bunch of code &amp; graphics in a SWF and get better performance.  Still I wouldn&#8217;t choose one or the other based on performance.)<\/li>\n<li>advocates Flash nuggets &#8212; I love this term!<\/li>\n<li>Full screen is nice &#8212; use it for good, not for evil<\/li>\n<li>invisible Flash &#8212; you might not even know you are using Flash.
