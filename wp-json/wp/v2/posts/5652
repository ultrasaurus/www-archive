With the help of open source contributors and colleagues at 18F, I created the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/18F\/open-data-maker\">Open Data Maker project<\/a> that powers the <a href=\"https:\/\/collegescorecard.ed.gov\/data\/documentation\/\">College Scorecard API<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/collegescorecard.ed.gov\/search\/?avg_net_price=..16000&amp;completion_rate=0.44..&amp;median_earnings=35000..&amp;degree=b&amp;major=history&amp;sort=advantage:desc\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Screen-Shot-2015-09-13-at-7.36.42-PM-225x300.png\" alt=\"filter UI with sliders for cost, graduation rate and salary after attending\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-5656\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Screen-Shot-2015-09-13-at-7.36.42-PM-225x300.png 225w, https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Screen-Shot-2015-09-13-at-7.36.42-PM.png 410w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/a>The really innovative work was done by the Department of Education, bringing together data from Treasury and IRS, combined with their previously open data from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www2.ed.gov\/about\/offices\/list\/ope\/index.html\">Office of Postsecondary Education<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In working on this project, I learned that the average high school graduate earns $25,000 per year. One way to look at the the value of the education offered by a particular school is the percentage of students who later earn more than those without a college education.  This was chosen as the default sort order (&#8220;% Earning Over HS Grad&#8221;).<\/p>\n<p>The site allows some filtering on additional data points: cost, graduation rate, and salary after attending.  Looking at 4-year liberal arts schools (by picking those that offer a History degree), that are below average cost, and higher than average graduation rate and salary after attending, I found these results:<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"https:\/\/collegescorecard.ed.gov\/search\/?avg_net_price=..16000&amp;completion_rate=0.44..&amp;median_earnings=35000..&amp;degree=b&amp;major=history&amp;sort=advantage:desc\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/filtered-search-cropped.png\" alt=\"Harvard, Stanford, Georgia Institute of Technology, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Michigan Technological University, University of Delaware, Texas A&amp;M...\" width=\"1164\" height=\"1567\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5674\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/filtered-search-cropped.png 1164w, https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/filtered-search-cropped-223x300.png 223w, https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/filtered-search-cropped-761x1024.png 761w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1164px) 100vw, 1164px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I was surprised to see Harvard and Stanford at below average cost &#8212; it is great to see these schools putting their large endowments to good use.
