Failure is a big part of success.  You don&#8217;t want to be making mediocre stuff.  He says that killing is a big part of bringing something great to life.  While the whole killing metaphor doesn&#8217;t resonate with me, I agree with his perspective on the process.  For every great idea for every compelling story, you need to leave a huge amount of footage on the floor of the editing room.  In software, we toss out ideas on the whiteboard, discuss and discard dozens of approaches, and experiment with quick prototypes, all so that we can release one great feature or workflow.  The code that is left behind after the editing process will then be clean, internally consistent and enable the person using the software to achieve their goals smoothly and easily.<\/p>\n<p>This short clip is worth watching:<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;All web apps are trying to suck.
