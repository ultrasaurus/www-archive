(If I&#8217;ve forgotten any, let me know.)<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to be able to say that I like public speaking.  I certainly welcome the opportunity to do it, and it&#8217;s growing on me. I love the chance to meet interesting people who come talk to me after the event.  I&#8217;ve actually grown to enjoy the doing of it &#8212; in the moment, on stage, speaking about something I am passionate about.  However, before the event is a struggle.  I&#8217;m not sure I can call it &#8220;stage fright&#8221; since once I start talking I&#8217;m fine.  I always have to over-prepare.  I usually create way more material than I need, and then pare it down.  I try to give my talk at least once completely so that I can get the timing of it, but I always feel stupid talking without an audience.  It&#8217;s even harder with a fake audience, but it&#8217;s better practice.  For small groups, if I know the topic really well, sometimes I just wing it with an outline, but I&#8217;ve usually gone through four or five potential talks in my head before the event.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m obsessive.  I think that being really prepared it&#8217;s the only way to do it well, at least for me.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few things I do to get through public speaking panic, so I can can enjoy the event:<br \/>\n* think about the audience: who are they?  why do Ithey care about what I&#8217;m talking about?  what do they want to learn?  (sometimes a good way to start the talk is to ask questions of the audience)<br \/>\n* prepare a great outline (this is never the same as a great set of slides &#8212; they complement each other)<br \/>\n* write down the first sentence (or the first few sentences) of the talk<br \/>\n* practice giving the talk while in the shower or driving or cooking dinner &#8212; it&#8217;s great to be able to talk while focusing on something else (in the live talk, that would be the audience)<br \/>\n* practice giving the talk to other people (to get their feedback, to make it real)<\/p>\n<p>What do you do to prepare a great talk?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I just updated the info about me on this website.
