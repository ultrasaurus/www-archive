I sent them this bit of feedback, although it was a bit of a hunt to find a comment form.<\/p>\n<p>I was going to sign up anyhow and even filled out most-of the form (using one of my anti-spam e-mail accounts).  The web form did have a nifty in-line validation check for matching e-mail addresses that I liked.  Sadly I found that gender and birthday were not optional.

If you aren&#8217;t up for creating a Flash walk-through, how about just putting the images up in a series of HTML pages?<\/p>\n<p>Normally I save my blog for writing about fun, happy things, and I started this entry because I hoped funchain would be one of them.  I publish this in hopes that someone over there might notice and fix some of these issues.<\/p>\n<p>(via <a href=\"http:\/\/migs.paraz.com\/wordpress\/index.php?p=95\">What is Not<\/a> via a comment on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/sarahblog\/archives\/000115.html\">26 countries<\/a>.
