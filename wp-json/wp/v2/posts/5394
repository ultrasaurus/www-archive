A $5 one-time fee for someone to generate a number for me seemed much more reasonable.  However, it turns out that many of these are scams &#8212; selling invalid codes or ones they don&#8217;t own or don&#8217;t have license to re-sell.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230; if a company joined the Uniform Code Council (now GS1-US) prior to August 28, 2002, the Uniform Code Council&#8217;s membership and licence agreement did not contain any prohibition against subdividing the numbers&#8230; This appears to have been a side consequence of the class action settlement. The product numbers from these companies are legitimate, however they will only be valid for as long as the companies are in business.<br \/>\n&#8212; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adams1.com\/faq.html\">BarCode1 FAQ<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.laurerupc.com\/\">George Laurer<\/a>, who developed the Universal Product Code in 1973, maintains a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.laurerupc.com\/\">UPC Blacklsit<\/a> and recommends this <a href=\"http:\/\/authenticatedupcregistrationdirectory.org\/node\/48\">UPC registered sellers list<\/a>.
