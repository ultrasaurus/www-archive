I agree wholeheartedly.  I have found that keeping a blog has made me a better writer.

I kept reading about Huygens probe which landed on Titan, named after the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens.  I know a Dutch phrase or two but had no idea how to pronounce this name.  The internet to the rescue! A kindly soul had wondered the same thing and after doing some research, he <a href=\"http:\/\/frank.harvard.edu\/~paulh\/misc\/huygens.htm\">posted<\/a> his findings.  I am consistently delighted with how I can indulge my idle curiosity, as well as semi-serious scientific inquiry, with a quick search of the web.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;the web is making us more literate &#8211; better readers, better writers&#8221; writes Elise Bauer (Not Always On).
