There\u2019s a conference coming up here in San Francisco. It\u2019s called <a href=\"http:\/\/officeoptional.co\/\">Office Optional<\/a>. It\u2019s for people who work with or without a hard-walled office. As Balsamiq Studios is a distributed company with only one office in Europe, the rest of our employees are all distributed. I got a heads-up about this conference, and after taking a <a href=\"https:\/\/continuingstudies.stanford.edu\/courses\/previouscourse.php?cid=20132_PDV+77\">class at Stanford<\/a> about neuroplasticity and happiness I was motivated to answer this call for talks. My pitch was meant to be a two to three-minute video that took about 10 hours to prepare.<\/p>\n<p><em>Sarah<\/em>:  Wow. 10 hours&#8230; why so long? or maybe I should ask: why so short?<\/p>\n<p><em>Val<\/em>: Yeah, it was long because I had never given a talk before, so really, that was a lot of preparation for what the content would be, and working out the technology of videotaping me, what was I going to wear in the video. I probably made 20 two-minute videos trying to hone my message, but I\u2019m really excited about it.<\/p>\n<p><em>Sarah<\/em>: Why give a talk?<\/p>\n<p><em>Val<\/em>: Yeah, for a bunch of reasons, one, because I\u2019m really excited about what I\u2019ve learned, and really want to share it with other people in my situation who, I think, are first of all growing in numbers. There are people who are just becoming work from home or work-remote employees. I\u2019ve been doing it for six years, and that\u2019s long enough for me to see some cycles. Second of all, because one of the things that I\u2019m dealing with is loneliness and connections with other people while working remotely and only having an online presence with people. To go to a conference, and actually press the flesh with other remote people will be, I hope, super-beneficial and refill my emotional tanks for a few weeks.<\/p>\n<p><em>Sarah<\/em>: Excellent.  That&#8217;s kind of meta.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"578\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Jl00ewWHq7I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>)<\/p>\n<p><em>Val<\/em>: Yeah.
