Instead of merely picking your top 5 or ranking features, you can decide what amount of money you want to spend on which feature.  We used to use this methodology for every release of Macromedia Director (perhaps they still do).  We had a fixed amount of engineering time to devote to new feature development, and we could do a rough guess of how expensive features were (ranked by $, $$, and $$$).  We used paper to gather input from the development team, product management and marketing, and small focus groups.  I would have loved to gather input from the loyal following on direct-l or a large group of prospective new developers using using this kind of online survey.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to providing a nice graphic experience for standard survey questions, Uzanto has created innovative online interactions for collecting information about higher level concepts.  Of particular interest are their methods of collecting data about how people categorize information which can be helpful for determining appropriate information architecture for a web site or testing existing categories.  My favorite is how they&#8217;ve implemented an &#8220;open sort&#8221; technique using drag and drop and free-form naming to get people to provide their own categories and names for them (pictured below).<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/images\/blog\/mindcanvas\/opensort.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The best part of The Mind Canvas happens behind the scenese.
