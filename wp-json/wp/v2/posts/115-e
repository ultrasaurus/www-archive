I think it&#8217;s true that a good GUI just looks so easy that some folks don&#8217;t value it.  It&#8217;s like a movie soundtrack.  To most folks when it&#8217;s good, the movie just seems like a better movie, and when it&#8217;s bad, the plot drags and the characters seem to lack depth.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a few more points from my list:<\/p>\n<p>* Good GUI involves interaction design.  You can&#8217;t draw a picture or a flow chart of it.  To know if it&#8217;s going to work you have to prototype it or even fully implement some of it.<\/p>\n<p>* GUI seems more subjective than it is.  Unlike a crash or some part of a program that gives an incorrect result, a usability bug can be hard to classify.  I&#8217;ve known many folks who would say that if it&#8217;s just pixels on the screen, the bug is cosmetic, and therefore unimportant.  A good UI engineer will classify it as simply &#8220;broken.&#8221;  If the pixels are in wrong place, the end user loses confidence and the UI stops working.<\/p>\n<p>* Human interfaces require soft edges.  Whether graphical or not, any thing that interacts with humans must be tolerant of mistakes.  Unlike machine-to-machine interaction which can be programmed to stay within safe boundaries, humans cannot be expected to do so.  There can&#8217;t be an edge condition which causes you to fall of a virtual cliff.  Interfaces which are not resilient to unexpected user behavior often fail to be useful.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Yeah, but so is anything worth doing.
