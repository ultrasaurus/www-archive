Just last week I read an interesting paper, which appears to be written by 3 men and a woman &#8212; all three men had websites, but I couldn&#8217;t find the fourth author&#8217;s website.  What&#8217;s up with that?<\/p>\n<p>Most of the men I know don&#8217;t have websites, and I read many sites clearly authored by women, yet this subjectively observed phenomenon persists, and it bugs me.  I never thought of my not having a website as a gender issue.  Was I the pot observing a host of other black kettles?<\/p>\n<p>This perceived gender disparity was the #2 reason I created this blog.

However, I cannot immerse myself in this thriving technical ecosystem without occasionally noticing that I&#8217;m the only woman in the room.  I&#8217;m thrilled that there are so many other technical women out there.  I hope that I will see a day when there as a many women as there are men who are involved in this fun and exciting work (and play).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/sarahblog\/archives\/000063.html\">read more<\/a> top ten reasons for a web log<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Whenever I read about someone doing interesting work or a paper someone has written, I like to look them up on the web.
