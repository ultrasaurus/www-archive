I loved the story about David Packard&#8217;s award for &#8220;extraordinary contempt and definace beyond the normal call of engineering duty.&#8221;  We&#8217;re not all cogs in a great machine, and it&#8217;s wonderful to hear about top level managers who know and appreciate that.<\/p>\n<p>This is an extension of the old: sometimes it&#8217;s easier to get forgiveness, than to get permission.  I definitely believe in a management style that puts more power and autonomy in the hands of the people who do the work.  (Not that management isn&#8217;t work, but you know what I mean.)  You hire the right people and give them responsibility and they make magical things happen.  It&#8217;s important that I know what&#8217;s going on, and often I like to be consulted, but I&#8217;ve been known to reprimand employees for doing what I told them to do when they knew better.  I hire people who know what they&#8217;re doing, who are smart, who I can trust.<\/p>\n<p>I think it creates an enviroment where good people like to work, but I&#8217;m not driven by purely altruistic motives.  I think it makes people more productive and effective, but I don&#8217;t just do it for the bottom line.  I, personally, have other things I&#8217;d rather be doing.  If I trust people and let them do their jobs (and define their jobs to be big enough to take on real responsibilities and take initiative), then I have time to write code myself.  People have remarked that it is a great thing in for an engineering manager to be deeply in touch with the tech, but that&#8217;s not the real motivation.  I, personally, want the simple joys of coding and practical, tangible problem-solving to be an everyday part of my life.  It&#8217;s not enough to be the &#8220;idea guy&#8221; &#8212; I also want to be &#8220;at the bottom&#8221; where the real innovation happens.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;In my experience, innovation can only come from the bottom.
