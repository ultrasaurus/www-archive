In the photo app overview screen you can scan through 150 images on the same surface. In the weather app you can slide across cities.  Likewise when looking at a collection of photos, it is not &#8220;one damn thing after another, as in a stack on images, rather you are sliding across a surface.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/images\/blog\/et-iphone\/stock-alt.png\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/images\/blog\/et-iphone\/sm-stock-alt.png\" \/>&lt;\/a<br \/>\nTufte&#039;s alternate stock app mockup<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/images\/blog\/et-iphone\/stock.png\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/images\/blog\/et-iphone\/sm-stock.png\" \/><\/a><br \/>\niPhone stock app<\/p>\n<p>When looking at a single photo, web browsing or text messaging on the iPhone, &#8220;the content is the interface&#8221; with no &#8220;adminstrative debris.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He critiques the stock app as having a cartoon interface, and suggests that they should use image resolution, instead it looks like a &#8220;powerpoint slide&#8221; with strong colors and zebra stripes and a &#8220;chartoon&#8221; stock graph.  He has mocked up an alternative (below) that shows much more data by using image resolution:  6 graphics, 14,000 numbers worth of data accurate to 2 significant digits, 24 numbers accurate to 5 significant digits.<\/p>\n<p>Although he likes the weather app, he also suggests that it would be more effective, if it provided more information, taking advantage of image resolution:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/images\/blog\/et-iphone\/weather-app.png\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/images\/blog\/et-iphone\/sm-weather-app.png\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>iPhone weather app (left), Tufte&#8217;s alternate mockup (right)<\/p>\n<p>In general, I agree with many of Tufte&#8217;s critiques and suggestions, but I hear my grandmother&#8217;s complaints in my mind&#8217;s ear about print too small for her to read.  I&#8217;ll bet the Apple designers were under pressure to make fonts large and lines thick.  I do like many of the ideas in Tufte&#8217;s stock app mockup, but for the weather, I prefer the iPhone&#8217;s simpler, larger display &#8212;  the large weather graphic doesn&#8217;t really add a lot for me.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Edward Tufte has produced a nice video critique of the iPhone.
