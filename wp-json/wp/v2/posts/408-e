It is about story telling, setting context, establishing mood and helping someone find their way.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Teleportation<\/strong><br \/>\nOn a mobile phone, you have the design challenge of very few inputs and outputs.  The screen size and resolution are small, and it is easy to have a scattered experience.  The mobile UI is composed of many, many states.  Without visual continuity, it is like teleportation, which one can only imagine would be a disorienting experience.  Christian compares it to taking the NYC subway a few blocks instead of walking.  You come up above ground and you don&#8217;t know what direction you are facing and exactly how to get where you want to go.  Whereas, if you walk there, you know exactly where you are.  Our eyes provide a very small slice of the visual field, but our brains are adept at putting together complex maps of a scene or territory so we can find our way.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Emphasis<\/strong><br \/>\nMovement makes us look.  Christian compared a picture of large, fuchsia flowers and a low contrast photo of a lion blending into grass.  If that lion moves just a little, our eyes are drawn there.  The pretty colorful flowers are fairly uninteresting contrasted with the fear of death.  We&#8217;ve evolved to pay attention to motion.  As designers we can take advantage of that.<\/p>\n<p><strong>User Generated Motion<\/strong><br \/>\nChristian noted that to make motion feel natural, you can use traditional character animation effects like ease-in\/ease-out and secondary or residual motion.  However, as interaction designers we have an opportunity to incorporate the motion of a live human being in the design to create a richer, more textured experience.  Mouse movement creates an organic feel with a natural fluidity.  Even navigating through a list has randomness.<\/p>\n<p>Christian also provided a great list of practical tips of how to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cinematicinterface.com\/2008\/08\/inject-motion-into-design-process.html\">inject motion into the design process<\/a> that I&#8217;ve written up over a the cinematic interface blog.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On Wednesday evening, I heard Christian Robertson speak about Motion Design: Wayfinding and Storytelling in Mobile UI at IxDA SF.
