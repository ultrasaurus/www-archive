It can be very frustrating, especially as someone new to development, especially learning command line tools, git and debugging, but she was excited about it and found it very rewarding even when she was very new.  She usually spent 4-6 hours a day.  Anthony noted that if someone has experience with another framework, you can expect the timeline to be 2-3x faster.<\/p>\n<p>I liked this breakdown of stages in learning:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Learn the Language<\/li>\n<li>Get the Skills<\/li>\n<li>Cross the Chasm<\/li>\n<li>Leave Footprints<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>For me, as a developer with 20+ years of experience, I pick this stuff up fairly quickly. \u00a0I spent a few solid days on getting my dev env setup, understanding the major components and making small changes to a module. \u00a0As important as the code, is understanding its patterns and jargon. \u00a0The immersive experience of <a href=\"http:\/\/capitalcamp.org\/\">CapitalCamp<\/a> with its enthusiastic community and these references to key learning resources has significantly accelerated the learning curve.<\/p>\n<p>This learning path focuses on the non-programmer; however, Anthony suggested (and I agree) that the experienced developer would take a similar path.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Register at <a href=\"https:\/\/drupal.org\/\">drupal.org<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/drupal.org\/planet\"> drupal.org\/planet<\/a> should be your home page, with news feeds of all the best blogs online<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/drupal.org\/security\">drupal.org\/security<\/a> &#8211; the Drupal security team meets once a week and issues security advisories less frequently &#8212; they also have a mailing list.<\/li>\n<li>Meetups &#8212; Anthony learned by reading <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Pro-Drupal-Development-John-VanDyk\/dp\/1590597559\">Pro Drupal Development<\/a> &amp; going to meetups. (He noted that the community is a bit less friendly on line.)
