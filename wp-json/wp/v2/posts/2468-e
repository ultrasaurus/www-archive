We all brainstormed techniques about how to support more women as engineers and as founders of companies. <\/p>\n<p>We talked about pros and cons of having a specific social network for women.  Angie pointed out that a lot of networks and resources already exist &#8212; can we leverage those?  Is it just that women don&#8217;t take advantage of what is available to them?  Does everyone know how willing successful women (or really most people) are to have a conversation with someone seeking advice?  Do people know how you can really go far if you are just willing to ask for what you need\/want?<\/p>\n<p>We all had read the book <a href=\"http:\/\/www.womendontask.com\/\">Women Don&#8217;t Ask<\/a> and Angie had the idea to give one to every attendee at the next Girl Geek Dinner if she can find someone willing to sponsor the initiative.  I think that would be just the thing to have an impact.<\/p>\n<p>I talked about my hopes and aspirations for the <a href=\"http:\/\/sfrubyworkshops.com\/\">SF Ruby Workshop<\/a> project.  I am so excited by the volunteers who are stepping up to lead workshops this year.  Having read <a href=\"http:\/\/www.starfishandspider.com\/\">The Starfish and the Spider: the unstoppable power of leaderless organizations<\/a> and inspired and encouraged by the men and women in the Ruby community, I believe that we can really make this thing self-replicating, provide opportunities for new leaders while drawing more women into (or back into) software development. I feel like there are some great stories that should be told and that we could do a better job of getting the word out.  Angie suggested that post asking if anyone is interested in taking on social media  \/ marketing.  Doh!  so&#8230; any one out there wanna help?  It wouldn&#8217;t take a lot of work to make a big difference!<\/p>\n<p>Lots of other ideas percolating from today&#8217;s meeting.  It is inspiring to be in the company of other awesome women pursuing similar goals. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It was amazing to have lunch today with Angie Chang of Women 2.0 and Bay Area Girl Geek Dinners and Jen-Mei Wu who is currently working with me at Blazing Cloud.
