I could see using this for a graduation slide show or other celebratory event that yearns for a retrospective, but when I&#8217;m not up for losing myself in AfterEffects for several days to make it happen.  <\/p>\n<p>The sign-up is very easy and I&#8217;m quickly brought to a screen which is pre-populated with images and a soundtrack.  I created a video of this, just to get the hang of it.  <\/p>\n<div class=\"thumbnail\"><a href=\"http:\/\/skitch.com\/ultrasaurus\/bqupk\/stupeflix-editor-video-creation-made-easy\"><img src=\"http:\/\/img.skitch.com\/20090508-t528puwctp29ejust13trtycsm.preview.jpg\" alt=\"Stupeflix Editor - Video creation made easy\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>It&#8217;s a good thing they offered that, since once I cleared the screen to start my own project.  I had a &#8220;deer in the headlights&#8221; moment while I stared at a mostly blank screen and pondered what to do next.  (A few big buttons in the middle of the screen at this point would be a vast improvement to keeping me &#8220;in the flow.&#8221;)  Admittedly, it only took me a few seconds to spot the &#8220;Add Images&#8221; button at the bottom on the screen.<\/p>\n<p>I found it odd that you can&#8217;t add a soundtrack till after you add images (there&#8217;s a menu under the subtle [+] in the upper-right of the image below).  My first instinct was to start with a soundtrack.  Nevertheless, I could upload a bunch of images at one and they&#8217;ve implemented the most fabulous upload feedback I&#8217;ve seen yet:<\/p>\n<div class=\"thumbnail\"><a href=\"http:\/\/skitch.com\/ultrasaurus\/bquqq\/stupeflix-editor-video-creation-made-easy-1\"><img src=\"http:\/\/img.skitch.com\/20090508-nq24qqyu6yumsxfp5jy1b2q39.preview.jpg\" alt=\"Stupeflix Editor - Video creation made easy-1\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>I was screwing around with the UI and seeing what would happen if I dragged an image from the desktop&#8230; the browser went to another web page and ACK!  I just lost my whole project. These guys are in serious need of a &#8220;save&#8221; button. Ugh.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, I persisted in my quest for a quick video fix. I re-imported the images and put together a video in about 20 minutes, then spent 15 minutes looking for a sound track.

The effect are semi-randomly generated (with some effects depending on the number of photos in a group).  I could control them, if I were motivated, by editing the xml by hand. It&#8217;s a neat way to give your early adopters a ton of control while your UI catches up.  <\/p>\n<p>Overall, this is really neat.
