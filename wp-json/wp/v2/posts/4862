She argues most valuable, but I&#8217;m not sure about that &#8212; at least not the structured data we already have.  If we can turn our so-called &#8220;content&#8221; into data and see behaviors of our customers, our visitors, even ourselves as data, those insights can dramatically change our perspective.  Arguably, big data allows us to turn large, quickly changing, or complex data into small, simpler, structured information that we can act on.<\/p>\n<p>I love the term &#8220;dark data&#8221; &#8212; data we already have, but aren&#8217;t looking at.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\nWhen mining big data, you&#8217;ll find unexpected<br \/>\n(but real) results. Don&#8217;t start a project if you&#8217;re<br \/>\nunwilling to deal with the findings.\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The most exciting aspect of Big Data, from my perspective, is that data formats are less important, the structure of the data can be inferred later.  For our most critical and urgent challenges, we don&#8217;t know the questions at the time that we start collecting data.  Sicular notes that with big data, we can ask bigger questions.
