Most of the people on the internet have used software with my code in it.   I can debug with the best of them.  However, I really do like it when stuff just works.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve loved moveable type and the whole notion of blogging.  So what if I could code a whole web site in raw HTML?  I could also type in binary, but who would want to?  Hey, give me a simple form to fill out and I&#8217;ll find some spare minutes in my week to collect and publish my thoughts.  I don&#8217;t need to make plans or data structures or any decision beyond which words to put into the box.<\/p>\n<p>Tonight my lackadaisical attitude caught up with me.  I was writing a (different) blog entry when I was suddenly confronted by:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saving entry failed: Can&#8217;t open file: &#8216;mt_entry.MYD&#8217;. (errno: 145)<\/p>\n<p>Eek!  I rushed right back to copy and paste my latest words into a safe haven, then proceeded to investigate.  Now &#8220;Sarah Allen&#8217;s Weblog Editing Menu&#8221; reports no entries, not zero, mind you, its:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entries: Comments: 192 Authors: 1<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s like the entries never even showed up to play.  The comments are winning and the author has surely lost.  A quick glance at www.ultrasaurus.com reveals a completely blank page &#8212; I had to view source to be sure:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;\/body&gt;&lt;\/html&gt;<\/p>\n<p>My life flashes before my eyes.  All those moments when I could have backed up my data, yet didn&#8217;t.  Being able to write software makes me no more eager to back up my data than being good at algebra makes me want to balance my checkbook.  It&#8217;s worse than dust bunnies in the corners, dishes in the sink, or broken windows.  You don&#8217;t ever see it, until its too late.<\/p>\n<p>Belatedly I back up my files and consider a future perl script to suck all those files back into a database if the situation turns out to be unrecoverable.  While the files download, I berate myself for not having upgraded movable type.  I dig thru Media Temple&#8217;s nifty control panel and realize that I haven&#8217;t  looked at this MySQL database since I set it up two years ago.  I don&#8217;t remember how to do any of this.  I&#8217;ve forgotten the passwords.  I notice that I&#8217;ve somehow managed to chew up almost all of my allotted disk space.  That can&#8217;t be good.  After a little housecleaning, the home page is still blank.<\/p>\n<p>I search google but the error string yields zero results and all my natural language descriptions generate helpful solutions for other problems.  I finally give up and describe my failure in detail in the movable type support forum.<\/p>\n<p>This leads me to my Eliza moment when I reproduce the error above and decide to search for part of the string.  I discover dozens of helpful tips on how to repair exactly this MySQL problem using PHPmyAdmin which was thoughtfully provided by my ISP.  I dig up the password and have to consult three different google results in order to find the exact steps through this challenging GUI:<br \/>\n1) click the check box next to the offending table<br \/>\n2) look all the way down to the bottom where you&#8217;ll see a drop-down menu<br \/>\n3) choose repair<\/p>\n<p>I repair two tables that had reported that they were &#8216;IN USE&#8217; and all is well.  I reply to my very own forum posting at movable type and resolve to rotate my log files and clear out my mailspool&#8230; tomorrow.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I consider myself a fairly techno-savvy kinda gal.
