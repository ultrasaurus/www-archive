I&#8217;ve come to feel that the 1 day workshops just give participants a taste of the technology and a quick peek at the power of Ruby on Rails.  After working on the course materials, I still feel that 4-days is a short time, but I am excited to have the opportunity to spend that much focused time teaching a group of students in a small, hands-on class.  If you have a need to learn Ruby on Rails, please <a href=\"http:\/\/marakana.com\/training\/ruby\/ruby_on_rails.html?a=sarah\">sign up<\/a>.  <\/p>\n<p>Note: this class has been given many times before at Marakana, so the testimonials are for previous classes with another instructor.  I&#8217;ll be bringing in some fresh ideas from my teaching experience, but I&#8217;ll also be leveraging Marakana&#8217;s experience of what has worked well in the past.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/img.skitch.com\/20091030-qgwp1sg77ymat4keka5scknsen.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For some, this is a high priced training.  You are paying for a great training facilities, class materials and an experienced instructor.  In terms of value delivered, I expect that to be well worth it and I hope my students will feel that to be true when they finish the class.  However, I know there are a lot of people who cannot afford such a class who could really benefit from it.  If you read this blog, you know that I do a lot of volunteer work in outreach to women with the <a href=\"http:\/\/sfrubyworkshops.com\/\">Free SFRuby Rails Workshops<\/a>.  I feel strongly that we all need to do what we can to make our community what we want it to be.  I&#8217;d like it to be diverse in terms of age, race, class, gender and any other aspect of the general population.  I am thrilled that Marakana feels the same way and we have agreed to offer full or partial scholarships for one or two students in the class.  <\/p>\n<p><strong>Scholarships available<\/strong><br \/>\nIf you feel that your presence will increase diversity in the Ruby on Rails community and  that taking this class could have a positive impact on your life and you would not otherwise be able to afford the class, please fill out <a href=\"http:\/\/spreadsheets.google.com\/viewform?formkey=dEdpay16SEJ0dWF4UUhFYUdvc1NDemc6MA\">this short form<\/a>.  Our decision on the candidate will balance your need, how much taking this course will have a beneficial effect and your potential impact on the community.  Bonus points for bloggers and twitterers or people who otherwise spread their know-how.  <\/p>\n<p>Special thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/marakana.com\/\">Marko Gargenta<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.banane.com\/\">Anna Billstrom<\/a> for helping to make the scholarships happen.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I am excited to be teaching a Ruby on Rails class at Marakana in San Francisco on Nov 16-19th.
