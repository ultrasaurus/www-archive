However, a friend who has Nubian goats tells me they also have them and they are called &#8220;wattles.&#8221;  Other <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dairygoatjournal.com\/issues\/86\/86-5\/what_are_wattles.html\">web sources<\/a> say they are also called &#8220;bells&#8221; or &#8220;skin tags&#8221; and appear to be found in many kinds of goats. &#8220;They serve no purpose and are believed to be a genetic trait &#8216;left over&#8217; from evolution.&#8221;  Hmmm.  Does this mean they are not tonsils or just that the tonsil is inside the wattle?  I suspect the former, so I&#8217;ve updated the picture below.  I desperately hope that one of my readers is an expert in goat anatomy and can help clear this up.<\/p>\n<div class=\"thumbnail\"><a href=\"http:\/\/skitch.com\/ultrasaurus\/bej4n\/iphoto-2\"><img src=\"http:\/\/img.skitch.com\/20090317-c1behynawcr2b494jf1bu43rqj.preview.jpg\" alt=\"iPhoto-2\" \/><\/a><br \/><span style=\"font-family: Lucida Grande, Trebuchet, sans-serif, Helvetica, Arial;font-size: 10px;color: #808080\">Uploaded with <a href=\"http:\/\/plasq.com\/\">plasq<\/a>&#8216;s <a href=\"http:\/\/skitch.com\">Skitch<\/a>!<\/span><\/div>\n<p>I also learned that llamas are effective guards against predators.
