I&#8217;ve got an investor pitch in the morning and I just tried the app on my Nokia phone and I&#8217;m no seeing search results any more.\u00a0 Can you look into it?<br \/>\n<strong>Client Engineer<\/strong>: I haven&#8217;t touched the code in\u00a0 months.\u00a0 It must be the server code.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Biz Guy<\/strong> (ring): Hi Sarah, this is Charlie.\u00a0 The mobile app isn&#8217;t working on my Nokia phone and Tony says he hasn&#8217;t changed the code in months.\u00a0 You said that server engineer you hired was really good, maybe he could fix it by tomorrow.<br \/>\n<strong>Manager<\/strong>: hmmm&#8230; I&#8217;ll check.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Manager<\/strong> (ring): Hey Wolf, this is Sarah.\u00a0 Did you make any changes lately that could have affected the mobile client?<br \/>\n<strong>Server Engineer<\/strong>: No&#8230; none of the APIs have changed and all of the tests pass. In fact, the mobile app demo on the website works and that uses the same APIs, so it must be a client problem.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Manager<\/strong> (ring): Hey Pat, this is Sarah. Glen told me the mobile app isn&#8217;t working, but the demo on the web does work.\u00a0 I understand they use the same APIs, so I&#8217;m guess the issue is in the mobile client code.<br \/>\n<strong>Client Engineer<\/strong>: Actually, the mobile app uses a slightly different authentication than the app on the web<br \/>\n<strong>Manager<\/strong>: Oh really, is that documented?<br \/>\n<strong>Client Engineer<\/strong>: well, there is detailed documentation of the platform SDK that the mobile phone doesn&#8217;t support http header responses so the auth token needs to be sent back in the post body<br \/>\n<strong>Manager<\/strong>: I see.\u00a0 Unfortunately, our server engineer isn&#8217;t actually familiar with the mobile platform SDK.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This is a critical problem in my experience and a very common one.  Whenever you have API documentation, it is usually incomplete, inaccurate or both, often despite the best intentions of everyone involved.  In this case, we solved the problem of documenting and testing XML APIs by writing cucumber scenarios which serve as both the documentation and tests.  By making the documentation executable with published results in a continuous integration system, we always have up to date documentation.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cucumber BDD framework: <a href=\"http:\/\/cukes.info\/\">http:\/\/cukes.info\/<\/a> and<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.github.com\/aslakhellesoy\/cucumber\"> http:\/\/wiki.github.com\/aslakhellesoy\/cucumber<\/a> Webrat (gem)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.github.com\/aslakhellesoy\/cucumber\/fixtures\">Using DB fixtures in cucumber<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Using XML fixtures to compare server response: <a href=\"http:\/\/github.com\/mightyverse\/xml_subset_matcher\/tree\/master\">xmlsubsetmatcher library<\/a> (there&#8217;s a gem spec in the github repo, but it is not yet working as a gem)<\/li>\n<li>Example: <a href=\"http:\/\/github.com\/mightyverse\/cucumber_xml\/tree\/master\">http:\/\/github.com\/mightyverse\/cucumber_xml<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The slides from the talk are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/sarah.allen\/streamlined-geek-talk-1727826\">posted on slideshare<\/a>:<\/p>\n<div id=\"__ss_1727826\" style=\"width: 425px;text-align: left\"><a style=\"font:14px Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif;margin:12px 0 3px 0;text-decoration:underline\" title=\"Streamlined Geek Talk\" href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/sarah.allen\/streamlined-geek-talk-1727826\">Streamlined Geek Talk<\/a><\/p>\n<div style=\"font-size: 11px;font-family: tahoma,arial;height: 26px;padding-top: 2px\">View more <a style=\"text-decoration:underline\" href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/\">presentations<\/a> from <a style=\"text-decoration:underline\" href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/sarah.allen\">Sarah Allen<\/a>.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last night Wolfram Arnold and I gave a talk at the SF Ruby Meetup about a recent collaboration where we created specs, documentation and tests using cucumber to streamline workflow and communication between client and server engineers.
