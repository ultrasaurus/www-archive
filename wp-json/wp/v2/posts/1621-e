There&#8217;s a <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.github.com\/activescaffold\/active_scaffold\/how-to-approach-active-scaffold-use-cases-benefits\">nice intro<\/a> on the github wiki that outlines common use cases:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> Prototyping<\/li>\n<li>Admin Interfaces<\/li>\n<li>Embedded, Widget-Style<\/li>\n<li>Data-Heavy Applications<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The use case that led me to ActiveScaffold today was the creation of an admin interface.\u00a0 I&#8217;m working on a website and the end user stuff is pretty nice, but there are a bunch of tables where the data needs a little love&#8230; no one wants to launch the site without at least a few corrections in the data and it is crazy to either delay the launch while we build an admin interface or have an engineer make corrections with sql updates.\u00a0 Enter ActiveScaffold: a way to allow admins to make the changes they need with very little software development.\u00a0 (Later I expect we&#8217;ll need to add some fancy bits to the admin interface, but ActiveScaffold promises to be configurable and extensible enough when the time comes and the key point is that I don&#8217;t expect to need those features this week.)<\/p>\n<h2>ActiveScaffold for Admin<\/h2>\n<p>Make a little app for this experiment:<br \/>\n<code><br \/>\nrails active_scaffold<br \/>\ncd active_scaffold<br \/>\n.\/script\/generate scaffold Task title:string notes:text\u00a0 complete:boolean<br \/>\nrake db:migrate<br \/>\n<\/code><br \/>\nInstall the plugin, which is compatible with Rails 2.3.2 (yay!) and previous versions of rails (if you <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.github.com\/activescaffold\/active_scaffold\/getting-started\">install\u00a0 a specific revision<\/a>)<br \/>\n<code><br \/>\n.\/script\/plugin install git:\/\/github.com\/activescaffold\/active_scaffold.git<br \/>\n<\/code><br \/>\nNow we have an app that lets you create, view, edit and delete tasks.  This is the end-user app, you could edit the views and remove controller actions to prevent editing, deleting and\/or creation.  We want to leave this interface as is, but create a separate set of pages to allow an administrator to view, create, modify and delete tasks.<\/p>\n<p>Sean came up with the idea of using routes with a namespace to facilitate this.  Here&#8217;s what we came up with:<\/p>\n<p>In config\/routes.rb add the following code:<br \/>\n<code><br \/>\n  map.namespace :admin do |admin|<br \/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;admin.resources :tasks<br \/>\n  end<br \/>\n<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Create a copy of \/app\/views\/layouts\/tasks.html.erb and call it admin.html.erb (in same folder), then add the following lines inside the &lt;head&gt; tag:<br \/>\n<code><\/p>\n<p><\/code><\/p>\n<p>Create app\/controllers\/task_controller.rb:<br \/>\n<code><br \/>\nclass Admin::TasksController &lt; TasksController<br \/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;layout &quot;admin&quot;<br \/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;active_scaffold :task<br \/>\nend<br \/>\n<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Check it out:<br \/>\n<code><br \/>\nhttp:\/\/localhost:3000\/admin\/tasks<br \/>\n<\/code><br \/>\n<img src=\"http:\/\/img.skitch.com\/20090702-tgy9a9y5g981xf589k6b3txjym.jpg\" \/><br \/>\nand when you click edit:<br \/>\n<img src=\"http:\/\/img.skitch.com\/20090702-mm8tr6jceckp7y78kbc495nwnq.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The ActiveScafold plugin for Rails promises to be a huge time saver.\u00a0 In just a few easy steps, you can create a full web interface for your database, complete with inline editing and fold out panels.\u00a0 Of course, it helps to have some grasp about what it is doing or you can get stuck like&hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/2009\/07\/getting-started-with-activescaffold\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":84,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1621"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/84"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1621"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1621\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1621"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1621"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1621"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
