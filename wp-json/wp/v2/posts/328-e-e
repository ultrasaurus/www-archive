I was checking out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meevee.com\/video\/watch.aspx\">meevee tv<\/a> with my 9 year old son.  &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; he says as he overhears the sound on my PC.  &#8220;This site was made with my software,&#8221; I tell him as I check out the &#8220;viral&#8221; section of the site.  The first video, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailymotion.com\/video\/x27ybx_afroninja_fun\">Afroninja<\/a>, has him laughing out loud.  Then I check out an old favorite: <a href=\"http:\/\/crackle.com\/c\/Extreme\/diet_coke_and_mentos_show\/931857\/#ml=o%3D12%26fi%3D%26fpl%3D55786\">diet coke and mentos show<\/a>, and he says: &#8220;really? this was made with your software?&#8221;  It was kinda cool to be able to say &#8220;well, the movie was made with software I made a few years ago when I worked at Macromedia, the rest of the website is made with software I made working at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.laszlosystems.com\">Laszlo<\/a>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I really like when you click on a category in the left navigation panel, how the options at the top change using a visual transition that animates up.  It makes a nice connection between the user action and the consequence, which contributes to the usability of the site.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/images\/blog\/meevee\/meevee-tv.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/images\/blog\/meevee\/meevee-tv-small.png\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I also just had to check out the &#8220;cute overload&#8221; category, which is accurately named.  After watching 11 seconds of  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CF3kwyO4N6A\">baby squirrel on a fence<\/a>, I reached my baby squirrel capacity.  I did, however, fast forward a few times and we both laughed at the shot below.  Jack laughed even harder when I declared that I must take a picture of it:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/images\/blog\/meevee\/baby-squirrel.png\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>meevee.com just launched a cool part of their site that uses OpenLaszlo.
