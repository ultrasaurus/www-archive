The target audience for this presentation includes both web interface designers and web application developers.<\/p>\n<p>A general consensus is emerging: The page-oriented HTML web is reaching its limits as an application platform, and the time has arrived for a foundation that supports more application-like experiences, preferably based on XML. But what does this application-like experience consist of? Is it simply the ability to deliver Windows-like applications into a web browser like Swing, but based on XML? Or is it something more?<\/p>\n<p>In this presentation, Bret Simister and Sarah Allen of Laszlo Systems describe what Laszlo believes is the next step in the evolution of web UI. This expressive, flexible user experience extends what we&#8217;ve learned on the web a UI that is a combination of application functionality, content, and branding, implemented via markup language. Bret and Sarah will demo what Laszlo describes as the &#8220;cinematic user experience,&#8221; and how its XML language, LZX, is designed to support the creation of these advanced, rich applications.<\/p>\n<p>Sarah and Bret will show how designers and developers can collaborate to build great applications that are scalable, modular, and maintainable, and how these teams can combine their core strengths to create the best possible user experiences using the Laszlo Presentation Server.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.baychi.org\/calendar\/20040707\/\">more details<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;ll be speaking at BayCHI next week&#8230; User Interface: The Future of the Web is not the Past of Windows Bret Simister and Sarah Allen, Laszlo Systems Wednesday, July 7, 6:30pm This event is co-sponsored by the Web Interface BOF and the Struts User BOF.
