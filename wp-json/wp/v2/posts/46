All this technology that we help create has implications that are both exciting and frightening. John Sundman\u2019s Acts of the Apostles is set in the near-future, or perhaps the present. This work of fiction feels close to reality.<\/p>\n<p>I thoroughly enjoyed the book &#8212; a fun and thought-provoking read. I especially enjoyed the contrast of east coast \/ west coast geek culture and engineering vs. marketing. Sundman\u2019s crisp descriptions of familiar moments reminded me of Gibson\u2019s Pattern Recognition. As an east coast transplant myself, California continues to be a foreign experience after over a decade in SF.

Mad Antonio\u2019s Nut House was no yuppie fern bar. Mad Antonio\u2019s was a dark place of pool tables, tattoos, stale beer and TVs that played tapes of Buster Douglas smashing Mike Tyson\u2019s face.
