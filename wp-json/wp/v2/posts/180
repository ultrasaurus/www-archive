Our first application is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.laszlosystems.com\/products\/laszloMail\/\" \/>Laszlo Mail<\/a>. You can see it live and in action if you are an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/cgi-bin\/mt\/www.earthlink.net\">Earthlink<\/a> customer. I really never thought writing an e-mail app would be fun, but this project has changed my mind. There&#8217;s real innovation required to create a effective mix of web application data model and desktop application UI. We develop our applications using the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/cgi-bin\/mt\/www.openlaszlo.org\">OpenLaszlo<\/a> platform with Java code on the back-end. You don&#8217;t have to know LZX to apply. I&#8217;ve found that any good engineer can pick it up pretty quickly.<\/p>\n<p>User interface developers seem to be a rare breed these days. I certainly appreciate what it takes to create a highly scalable server, but with old-world web technology, user interface development consists of generating a stream of text (well, HTML). For the past ten years or so, most industry jobs simply did not  provide the opportunity to design or develop great interactive UIs. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love the web. I just think it can get a whole lot better.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m looking for a software developer who is passionate about building great user experiences &#8212; software that is usable and that people want to use. You might be an AJAX guru&#8230; or you could be a Flash developer, but if so, you&#8217;d better have some real engineering experience and know-how. Or perhaps, like me, you used to develop desktop applications before moving to client\/server or web application development.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, we&#8217;re hiring.  It could be full-time or contractor, but must be local to the SF Bay Area, since you&#8217;ll want to come into the office most days.  If you&#8217;re interested, send your resume along with URL references to your work (if available online) to resumes _at_ laszlosystems _dot_ com. Also, include a note that you learned about the job opening here.
