A great article, but not exactly what I was looking for.  Then I chanced to read danah&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zephoria.org\/thoughts\/archives\/000603.html\">capitalization rules<\/a> where Andrew Cone had left a link to an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.linguistlist.org\/~ask-ling\/archive-most-recent\/msg03071.html\">interesting discussion<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Only on the internet could I fulfill such random curiosity with such convenience.  While waiting for paper mache to dry I submitted the question to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.linguistlist.org\/~ask-ling\/\">&#8220;Ask A Linguist&#8221; list<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In case anyone else is curious, I&#8217;ve compiled a few highlights from the responses I received&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><br \/>\n<b>The short answer<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Originally, C spelled the sound \/g\/.  But, with some help from the Etruscans, the Romans got into a bit of a tangle here, and they wound up using C to spell both the sound \/g\/ and the sound \/k\/, while they hardly used the letter K at all.  Eventually, realizing this was a bad idea, they invented a new letter, G, to spell the sound \/g\/, and they then used C exclusively to spell the sound \/k\/.<\/p>\n<p>This was the system borrowed from the Romans by the Anglo-Saxons. Originally C spelled only \/k\/ in Old English.  But then the pronunciation of English changed.  (Larry Trask)<\/p>\n<p><b>Another important consideration<\/b><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8216;c&#8217; is often used (though not always) for roots whose pronunciation alternates between [s] and [k].  think of &#8216;public&#8217; vs. &#8216;publicity&#8217;.  If we spelled the first &#8216;publik&#8217; and the second &#8216;publisity&#8217; we wouldn&#8217;t be able to see the relationship between the two words as easily.&#8221; (Susan Fisher)<\/p>\n<p><b>A longer story<\/b><br \/>\n(this might make a good children&#8217;s book if it had pictures)<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a very good question, and the answer is that it didn&#8217;t always make those sounds.  See, the language we speak has changed over the centuries, as all languages do.  And writing &#8212; which is different from talking, changes too, though much more slowly.<\/p>\n<p>The letter C wasn&#8217;t invented for English.  It was invented several thousand years ago to write down the sounds of <a href=\"http:\/\/phoenicia.org\/alphabet.html\">Phoenician<\/a>, a language related to Hebrew and Arabic. At the time, the letter was called &#8220;gamel&#8221; or something like that, which means &#8216;camel&#8217; (see the C?). It represented the G sound (the letter G was invented later, by the Romans).<\/p>\n<p>Later on the Greeks started using the Phoenician alphabet and they used the letter to represent the G sound, too.  Not having any camels, they called it &#8220;gamma&#8221;; the K sound was represented by the letter K, called &#8220;kappa&#8221;.  And later still, people in Italy used it, but they didn&#8217;t have a G sound, so they used it for the K sound.<\/p>\n<p>The Romans eventually wound up using this alphabet, with the letter C standing for the K sound, but they did have a G sound, so they put a little jot on the C and made it a G (they didn&#8217;t use the letter K, except for words they borrowed from Greek).&#8221; (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.umich.edu\/~jlawler\">John Lawler<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In the Norman French era, &#8220;C&#8221; was pronounced &#8220;S&#8221; before the letters &#8220;I,E,(Y)&#8221;, and otherwise &#8220;K&#8221;, After William the Conquerer captured England in 1066, English borrowed a lot of French words with French spellings, so &#8220;C&#8221; became a letter with two sounds.  English also had words like &#8220;king, keep&#8221; where \/k\/ was pronounced before \/e,i\/, so the Greek letter &#8220;K&#8221; was reintroduced to keep things straight (more or less).&#8221; (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.personal.psu.edu\/ejp10\">Elizabeth J.
