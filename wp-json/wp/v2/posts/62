The process is facilitated by real world conversation and e-mail, but it wouldn&#8217;t be so practical and so easy without blogs.<\/p>\n<p>It all started back in July &#8211; August when <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.it\/0100198\/\">Marc Canter<\/a> suggested that Laszlo build something that bloggers could use, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.osteele.com\">Oliver Steele<\/a> prototyped a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mylaszlo.com\/lps\/ows\/lbw\/lbw.lzx\">laszlo blogging widget<\/a>.  Although Marc <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.it\/0100198\/2003\/08\/08.html#a1600\">talked about the project<\/a> on his blog and we had a few meetings about it at the office, I didn&#8217;t have a lot of time to dive in and build it.  So we talked and I waited for the time that the project would appear in my schedule or get handed off to someone else.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile Mark Davis was working on something completely different for his blog.  A <a href=\"http:\/\/drdreff.blogspot.com\/2003_09_07_drdreff_archive.html#106305830618139273\">nav toy<\/a> that could be paramterized to display a list of links.  The project included one hand-painted gradient png and about a hundred lines of LZX code.  Dan Lewis spotted it and handily provided some new gradients and a &#8220;powered by Laszlo&#8221; footer.<\/p>\n<p>I thought it was neat and and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/sarahblog\/archives\/000072.html\">wrote about it<\/a>.  Then I noticed an opportunity.  I saw a small improvement that would cause me to want to put it on my blog (adding an XML config file).  I set out to make that one change, then got excited and added a few others.  Later that night I had morphed it into an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/sarahblog\/archives\/000074.html\">OPML viewer<\/a>. Since I was coding quickly I took out all the parameterization and hard-coded the colors.<\/p>\n<p>Marc Canter sees it and e-mails me: &#8220;I want one of those &#8211; NOW!  I can&#8217;t wait.  What do I have to do?&#8221;  Lyndon Wong tells me that he wants one too.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Mark Davis has adopted <a href=\"http:\/\/drdreff.blogspot.com\/2003_09_07_drdreff_archive.html#106313611341290309\">a few changes<\/a> but wants to keep his HTML parameterization and extolls its virtues in a hallway conversation.  I realize that it would be cool to let the other folks  pick their own colors, so I go ahead and put that back in.<\/p>\n<p>So Canter puts my OPML viewer on <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.it\/0100198\/\">his page<\/a>, and Lyndon puts Mark Davis&#8217;s nav toy on <a href=\"http:\/\/lyndonwong.blogspot.com\/\">his page<\/a>.  Now <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.it\/0100198\/2003\/09\/16.html\">Marc has ideas<\/a> of how to glue it into <a href=\"http:\/\/topicexchange.com\/\">Topic Exchange<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.peopleaggregator.com\/\">PeopleAggregator<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Its latest incarnation was inspired by David Temkin&#8217;s suggestion that we should put a &#8220;view source&#8221; button right in the app so folks can easily get a glimpse of LZX, the language of Laszlo applications.  Peter Andrea whipped up some art.  Mark Davis came up with a name.  What&#8217;s next?<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re collaborating, but everyone is doing something different.  It&#8217;s really faciliated by the fact that that we&#8217;re working with a couple of text files and some linked art assets.  Each of us is doing not much work, but it builds up gradually.  It seems this little project is a microcosm of what a lot of folks are doing with larger prpjects, using blogs as a communications medium for facilitating loosely connected collaboration.<\/p>\n<p>I was interested using <a href=\"http:\/\/topicexchange.com\/\">TopicExchange<\/a>, so I thought I would track the history of this project so far as seen in blog posts.  I dug up links to various posts and started adding them to a <a href=\"http:\/\/topicexchange.com\/t\/laszlo_blogbox\/\">blogbox topic<\/a>.  After 6 entries, the form won&#8217;t respond.  I don&#8217;t know if its just this topic or a general issue.  Yet another work in progress :)  I&#8217;ll check back later.  In the meantime, I&#8217;ve posted the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/sarahblog\/notes\/blogbox_history.html\">thread of conversation<\/a> as html, if you are interested.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For the last few weeks I&#8217;ve been participating in a project that involves multiple people, yet has no meetings, no rules and is a great deal of fun.
