The decision you make when you are building a site has an effect on the end user &#8212; these are design decisions!<\/p>\n<p>Myth: it will take a long time and effort<br \/>\nFact: it could but it doesn\u2019t have to<br \/>\n<a name=\"control\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>More Control<\/h2>\n<p>We can make our content creators more productive by giving them &#8220;power tools&#8221; while at the same time, reducing risk that they will make mistakes will give them confidence to move faster.<\/p>\n<h3>WYSIWYG<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s not really an option anymore to tell people to edit HTML.  [My personal perspective is that even though I am perfectly capable of HTML markup, why should you make me type extra characters?  why should I have to learn the markup that works with your stylesheet?  Though I do like the option of editing HTML when the rich text editors fail me.]<\/p>\n<p>The following modules are good for WYSIWYG and File Upload:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/wysiwyg\">wysiwyg<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/ckeditor\">ckeditor<\/a> which both appear to be rich text, WYSIWYG editors<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/media\">media<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/wysiwyg\">imce<\/a> for uploading and managing file (also seems to be an either\/or choice<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Node Editing Power<\/h3>\n<p>Always check \u201cAdd to Menu\u201d on the Node Edit page &#8212; for most content creators, if a menu isn&#8217;t there, the feature doesn&#8217;t exist.<\/p>\n<p>With context, use a module with <a href=\"https:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/context_node\">Context Node<\/a> which can pull out just a few context options and put it on the Node Edit page.<\/p>\n<p>As a themer, you can make a bunch of templates and the content creator can pick with <a href=\"https:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/template-picker\">template -picker<\/a> module.<\/p>\n<h3>Use Short Codes<\/h3>\n<p>Short code are a best practice from WordPress and can accelerate content creation:<\/p>\n<pre>[video:url]\n[[nid:123]]<\/pre>\n<p>Drupal Modules:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/caption_filter\">Caption Filter<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/video_filter\">Video Filter<\/a> works with the wysiwyg module or with TinyMCE or CKEditor (not sure why those are in a different category).<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/insert_view\">Insert View<\/a> lets content editors add views without editing PHP<\/li>\n<li>Make your own<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In Drupal we tend to expose this kind of functionality as a block, but that gives the power to the site builder, rather than the content creator.  In Drupal, the modules that do this tend to be called filters.<\/p>\n<h3>Reduce Risk<\/h3>\n<p>Always put description text when you are creating new fields (you probably won\u2019t come back later).  If you are going to come back later, you can improve it then &#8212; at least put something in.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"drupal.org\/project\/autosave\">Autosave<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Revisions: just enable it by default<\/li>\n<li>Preview  &#8212; poor experiences with the preview button, not always what you expext<\/li>\n<li>Turn off preview button on content types page, use use <a href=\"https:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/view_unpublished\">view_unpublished<\/a> module instead<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Granting <strong>Appropriate Access<\/strong> is not an easy fix. \u00a0You need to understand how your organization works, know the users, watch them work, etc.  Once you do know those things, you can set up good workflows for them with clear options for the different roles in the organization.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the &#8220;shortcut menu&#8221; that comes with Drupal7<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/admin_menu_source\">Admin Menu Source<\/a> lets different roles have different menus<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/menu_item_visibility\">Menu Item Visibility<\/a> module &#8212; remember the menus are their interface<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a name=\"clarity\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Less Confusion<\/h2>\n<p>Admin Themes can help<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/rubik\">Rubik<\/a> is less cluttered: 2-column node-edit page, description text on<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/ember\">Ember<\/a> is responsive<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Logical Grouping<\/h3>\n<p>Group things according to how your content creators think about them, not how you built them.
