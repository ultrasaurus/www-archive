Sometimes I watch stupid TV shows on Netflix instead of having a conversation with my husband, or playing a game with my son, or calling my best friend because I&#8217;m worn out and frustrated and I forget that sitting in front of a screen for one more hour may feel easier but doesn&#8217;t really make me happy.<\/p>\n<p>I also agree with poet Ralph Hodgson who said that &#8220;some things have to be believed to be seen.&#8221;\u00a0\u00a0 One of the unique aspects of a founder is the creation of a &#8220;reality distortion field&#8221; that causes other people to participate in a shared belief thereby causing it to become reality.\u00a0 So, even though I fail every day to turn my beliefs into reality, I nonetheless hold them to be true. And everyday I work to create a wonderful, supportive learning environment where I can use that failure to change the reality of my life to reflect my beliefs along with a small part of the rest of reality through the software created by my team.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I believe&#8230; I do my best work when I also have time away to clear my head and reinvigorate my spirit.
