I&#8217;ve tried to bring what-has-worked in the past into the light of new requirements and opportunities.  An appropriate year-end post, I reflect on our most recent release and how our development style reflects what we&#8217;ve learned over the year, as well as old software management lessons.<\/p>\n<p>That article might have appeared here as easily as there.  Unexpectedly, I find myself a contributing author to four blogs (and the sole author of two of them).  I don&#8217;t think having more places to publish makes me write less in each, but rather creates more reason to write.  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flyingpaperclips.com\">Flying Paperclips<\/a> is a simple notebook of science experiments.  Some notes which might otherwise have been emails or checkin notes, now are published on the <a href=\"http:\/\/weblog.openlaszlo.org\/\">OpenLaszlo weblog<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>With the Laszlo Mail blog, I&#8217;m experimenting with what has been called &#8220;the obligatory development blog&#8221; of web software.  I grew up writing software in an atmosphere of secrecy, where one dare not discuss development methodologies for fear of violating NDAs and revealing trade secrets to a competitor.   Nowadays companies are more comfortable being open about how software is developed, or perhaps there was no danger before and my fear caused unnecessary self-censorship. In any case, I appreciate the developers who have created a well-trodden path, as I venture into this unexplored territory in my personal landscape.  I&#8217;m still unsure what is a daring revelation vs. a mundane, even uninteresting detail of private software development.  Every new release brings fresh challenges as well as familiar obstacles.  I enjoy reading how other people go about this act of creatng and publishing software.  It is fun to add my stories to the mix.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Over at the Laszlo Mail blog, I&#8217;ve written about a development style for the new millenium.
