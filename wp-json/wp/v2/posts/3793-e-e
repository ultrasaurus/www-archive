I love this stuff.<\/p>\n<p>But once upon a time, I was like most folk.  I thought that computer programmers had boring jobs where they typed in numbers into dead machines.  So, anytime someone asks&#8230; I mean, when they really want to know&#8230; I take time to tell them what it is really like, at least what it is like for me.  Because there&#8217;s no way you can really know till you do it, if you are one of those people who would want to sink into this alternate reality and make magic happen.<\/p>\n<p>I just got this letter in the mail yesterday.

I have 9 more letters to deliver to my former colleagues.  I&#8217;m going to enjoy hunting them down &#8212; I think I am only in touch with two of them.

There was some list, I can&#8217;t remember the name of, where we could send random, company-wide emails, or maybe it was just the Director team and friends.
