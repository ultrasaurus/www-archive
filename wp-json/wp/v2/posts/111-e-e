I have observed in the development of software that I experience two extremes.   One is where writing software is work.  I relentlessly chase a bug.  I perfect a piece of code through sheer persistence and fortitude.  It can be satisfying, but it is not fun.  The other extreme is where writing software is play.  I can&#8217;t imagine that someone pays me for such challenging entertainment.  Experimentation yields unexpected solutions.  The patterns revealed by the trail of a bug lead to insights.  Crafting a solution is a tangible, creative experience.<\/p>\n<p>I often wonder what key factors create the experience of play.  When I capture that way of working, I am undeniably more productive.  I can see no down side to taking that approach all of the time, except that its not a state consciously achieved.  One could argue that some things are just no fun.  However, I don&#8217;t believe that the level of play is inherent to the task.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;It is the essence of play that a new relation is created between the field of meaning and the visual field &#8212; that is, between situations in thought and real situations.&#8221; &#8212; Vygotsky Mind in Society &#8220;most of us are so busy trying to solve problems that we fail to notice that in solving problems&hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/2004\/03\/creativity-and-play\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/2004\/03\/creativity-and-play\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":84,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[14],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/111"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/84"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=111"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/111\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=111"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=111"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=111"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
