It was hard to tell whether these are issues with the Google Reader implementation or with Gears (but Aaron from the Gears team believes it was an issue with Reader and they are working to sort that out).  In any case, the whole experience was just a couple of minutes including setting up the reader with an opml file I had to go export from bloglines.<\/p>\n<div style=\"width:425px;text-align:left\" id=\"__ss_278883\">\n<div style=\"font-size:11px;font-family:tahoma,arial;height:26px;padding-top:2px\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/?src=embed\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.slideshare.net\/swf\/logo_embd.png\" style=\"border:0px none;margin-bottom:-5px\" alt=\"SlideShare\" \/><\/a> | <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/sarah.allen\/google-reader-gears-install?src=embed\" title=\"View 'Google Reader Gears Install' on SlideShare\">View<\/a> | <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/upload?src=embed\">Upload your own<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I posted to the gears group earlier today about the glitches in the Google Reader install experience and got a nice response from Aaron Boodman who suggested I check out remember the milk which has a nice offline experience implemented with Gears.
