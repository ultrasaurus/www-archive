I remembered how my mom pointed out to me years later the drawings I had made when we lived in Saint Lucia. All my houses had chimneys, even though we lived in this very hot, tropical climate with no fireplaces.<\/p>\n<p>She tells about her experience of negative bias where well-meaning people made assumptions about Africa. She also shares how she inadvertently made assumptions about others based on a single narrative that excluded the possibility of other attributes and experience.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is impossible to talk about the single story without talking about power. There is a word, an Igbo word, that I think about whenever I think about the power structures of the world, and it is &#8220;nkali.&#8221; It&#8217;s a noun that loosely translates to &#8220;to be greater than another.&#8221; Like our economic and political worlds, stories too are defined by the principle of nkali: How they are told, who tells them, when they&#8217;re told, how many stories are told, are really dependent on power&#8230; Power is the ability not just to tell the story of another person, but to make it the definitive story of that person.&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>It resonates with me how the negative stories <em>flatten<\/em> her experience. The creation of stereotypes by such storytelling is problematic not because they are entirely false, but because they are incomplete. &#8220;They make one story become the only story.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The consequence of the single story is this: It robs people of dignity. It makes our recognition of our equal humanity difficult. It emphasizes how we are different rather than how we are similar&#8230; when we reject the single story, when we realize that there is never a single story about any place, we regain a kind of paradise.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie&#8217;s the danger of a single story illustrates how we are influenced by the stories we read and the stories we tell.
