Spoken language evolves faster than written language, but the written language is easier to track as it leaves behind physical artifacts.  <\/p>\n<p>The third letter of our alphabet is the problematic C, which could be soft as in &#8216;nice&#8217; or hard like &#8216;cat&#8217; or I don&#8217;t know what you call the sound at the beginning of &#8216;chat.&#8217;  This ambiguity has frustrated spellers of English across generations. Many years ago I looked into the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrasaurus.com\/sarahblog\/2003\/08\/the-history-of-the-letter-c\/\">history of the letter C<\/a> in order to satisfy one kid&#8217;s curiosity that mirrored my own.    I learned about the Phonecian alphabet which pre-dated our own roman script, where the pre-cursor to our letter C sounded like a hard-G.  <\/p>\n<p>From the illustration above, you can see that evolution took place differently for Greek and Cyrillic.  Today in the same letter from the Cyrillic alphabet looks like this: \u0413 and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cyrillic_alphabets\">wikipedia tells me<\/a> that it sounds like &#8220;Ge.&#8221;  If only we had kept this letter as is, and adopted K and S more aggressively as spoken language drifted, we would have an easier time spelling words in modern English.  Although we would still have the challenging relationship between &#8220;public&#8221; and &#8220;publicity&#8221; where the written form illustrates the relationship between noun and verb.  The solution, of course, is that we should modify the spelling to &#8220;publik,&#8221; then we&#8217;ll need to all start saying &#8220;publikity&#8221; and everything would be easier to spell.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Notes<\/strong><br \/>\nI was delighted to find the visualization above (via <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/larsyencken\">@larsyencken<\/a>) which illustrates the evolution of various alphabets that includes Greek and Cyrillic, and as the Roman script we use for English.  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.radicalcartography.net\/index.html?alphabets\" target=\"_blank\">Bill Rankin at Radical Cartography describes this striking visualization<\/a> which includes a geographic map as a &#8220;relatively simply exercise&#8221; &#8212; simple for him!  I&#8217;m so glad he took a moment from his busy life to put it together.  <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Language evolves.
