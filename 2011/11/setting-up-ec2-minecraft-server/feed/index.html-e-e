					<description><![CDATA[Hmm. Micro instances automatically scale to 2 “elastic CPU units” or whatever they call them when the load is high. I wonder if using Java 7 and a different server would help.

“ssh -i ubuntu@ec2.pem ec2-” wait, what. Do you mean “ssh -i ec2.pem ubuntu@ec2-”?

&#062; Ubuntu takes up too much disk space by default to fit into a micro instance
Micro instances only work with EBS, 8 GB one is free. Ubuntu Server doesn&#039;t take that much space.

Also, you don&#039;t *have* to install Amazon&#039;s command line tools, you can use the web interface to control instances. And screen isn&#039;t cool, tmux is :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow -- nice catch, Gary!

Oddly Amazon shows no charges for this billing period, but I don&#039;t trust their reporting:  https://skitch.com/ultrasaurus/gmcrh/amazon-web-services

I&#039;m going to run thru the steps again for a micro instance -- we&#039;re only planning on hosting a few players, so I figured it was worth a try.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Isn&#039;t an EC2 micro instance free for a year, not a small instance?
Make sure you&#039;re not getting charged more than you think!
Micro probably doesn&#039;t have consistent enough CPU for gaming, unfortunately.]]></description>
