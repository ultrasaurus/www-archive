					<description><![CDATA[Good presentation. I really like your comments about how the tests really require students to read the error messages. Good stuff. When I teach TDD (to entry level Java students), I take a different approach as I found that even the tests themselves were too confusing for students when handed to them. I wrote about my methods and experiences here if you&#039;re interested. I&#039;d love your feedback on it.

Keep up the good work!

					<description><![CDATA[I really loved this talk.  I am in the process of writing my first iPad application, and I want to do it cleanly (via OCUnit), so this was a great refresher on the reasons to practice TDD.

I was wondering if you had images of the two diagrams of TDD vs traditional development in terms of productivity over time and cost per feature?]]></description>

Actually, I&#039;ve bought SizeUp, but it wasn&#039;t at all obvious where to put the license key and I&#039;m too lazy to read up on where to configure it.  It&#039;s a great utility -- you should pay for it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great presentation! Loved it!

Nice to see that you&#039;re also too lazy (or whatever) to buy SizeUp. Me too :)]]></description>
