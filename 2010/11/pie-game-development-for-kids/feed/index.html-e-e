					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the talk and for the post. I work at a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gameshastra.com/Video-Game-Development.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;game development&lt;/a&gt;firm and it&#039;s great to see more interest in getting kids into the, ahem, &#039;game&#039; early on - or at least sparking an interest. If these are kids that have a passion for game dev, they&#039;ll be happier the sooner they pursue it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sarah - did you see the talk abot RGen and Concrete?  Concrete would be perfect as a front-end for pie - don&#039;t even have to write code, just use the DSL directly.

I enjoyed your talk!  Look forward to seeing more.]]></description>
