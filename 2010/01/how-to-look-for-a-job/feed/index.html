					<description><![CDATA[Reed,

Both Ted and I have jobs and are both experienced hiring managers.  I didn&#039;t mean to apply that people should not apply for jobs or do traditional networking, but I don&#039;t believe that spending 100% of your time applying for jobs and interviewing is possible.  There is always downtime between interviews or when you are waiting for a response and you want to use that time to make yourself an expert (or at least more skilled) in your field.

					<description><![CDATA[Heres some advice from someone who actually has a job:
1. Don&#039;t write a blog, its a waste of time. Spend that time applying for jobs.
2. No one starts out in their ideal job. Be prepared to settle for your second or even third choice. The first step is always the hardest. Once you get in a company you can make contacts and move around.
3. You&#039;re best chance of finding your first job is through a relative or a friend. How far you advance after that depends on how hard and how smart you work.
4. A blog is public whining. Spend less time complaining and more time improving your current skills.
5. Out of every 40 job applications you make you will get one reply. Out of every 10 interviews you get called for only 1 company will take you seriously.

Sarah, your advice is too sugar coated and optimistic. It&#039;ll lead to people trying hard then failing and giving up. Be more realistic.]]></description>
