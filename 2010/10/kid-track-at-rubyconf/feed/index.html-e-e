					<description><![CDATA[Hello Sarah,

Great idea and Ruby Nuby would like to partner with you to make this happen.   Ruby Nuby teaches RoR, entrepreneurial skills and life skills to at-risk and disadvantaged youth who are sponsored by the professionals who take our courses.  They learn alongside each other creating socio-economic bridges. After their 9th grade and completion of Ruby Nuby camp, we place the youths in paid internships/part-time jobs that they work throughout high school.  By the time they graduate, they are hire-able as intermediate RoR developers with 4 years experience.  Companies that hire our graduates have to pledge full scholarships so the youths can work for them during the day and go to college at night getting their degrees.

Our website is being developed now www.rubynuby.net .  We have been teaching classes at NYU since Aug 9th, 2010.  

Thank you so much for doing this,
Malcolm Arnold

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Sarah! I know I said this to you a couple of weeks ago - before I returned to technology, in 2003, I gave secondary school teaching a whirl, and taught Biology for a bit in San Leandro (CA).  Based on that experience, and some of the volunteering I did in the Berkeley Unified School District teaching digital video editing to young children, I would be happy to help you deliver and organize whatever class you end up teaching.

Some opinions...

Forty-five minutes to an hour and a half is about right for each lesson, and I would say two lessons a day max. The other time would be spent applying whatever they learned in building something meaningful.

The Arduino idea sounds PERFECT, in that you could show something, at the beginning, which is a finished piece of work, that the kids could get excited about. They could also make it very personal, so each student could take some time to plan what it is that he or she would like to build, based on an interest, or something relevant to their lives (Dewey: &quot;Text without Context is Pretext&quot;).

I also like that Arduino involves something more than computers. It shows that these skills can be applied to anything that has a chip.

Awesome idea!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, you remember the DRb/Ruby-Processing server from mountain.rb, right?

Nick Howard has volunteered to run one for the grownups during the conference; maybe the kids would like to play, too.  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the idea of a kid track! Unfortunately, my kids are too young to learn to code (5 and 3: they have to learn to read English, first), but I have a 10 year old niece, and my sister is really into the idea of her gaining some technical skills. She had me set up a Linux netbook for her last year. I can&#039;t make it this year, but I&#039;d love to keep an eye on developments in the conference kid-track realm.]]></description>
