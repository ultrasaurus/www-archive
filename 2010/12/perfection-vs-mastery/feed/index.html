					<description><![CDATA[Sarah, many many thanks for this great post!

We technologists must dedicate a little time  every day to look beyond the 0&#039;s and 1&#039;s :), and read wonderful posts like this!

God bless you! Have a great 2011]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Sarah,

I&#039;m very touched that you - someone that I&#039;ve admired for a very long time found a tweet I sent your way to be helpful to you.

I&#039;ve been reflecting on these very same issues for the past year - and about learning and changing on a personal level, about empowering children to learn, and about building something that matters. Here&#039;s a bunch of thinking I&#039;ve been mulling over related to this that I&#039;ll leave for your reflection. I hope you find them as thought provoking and helpful as I have.
