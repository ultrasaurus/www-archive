					<description><![CDATA[I believe webrat is designed to work with rack apps, so it would work with Sinatra, but not PHP.  If you want to work with a non-Ruby webapp, look at Capybara using the Mechanize driver.

					<description><![CDATA[Sarah, thanks so much for sharing your efforts.  One question I have is this:
Do you have to use the ruby-rails framework to get webrat to work?  Can you just use garden-variety ruby?  It seems from all the sites I have visited, and the Rspec/Cucumber book I&#039;m using that webrat is tightly coupled to Ruby-rails.

Any insights you could share would be most appreciated.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello! I have another problem on winXP. After running rake featurer in your &quot;Describe a Feature&quot; chapter, this is what I got. It&#039;s OK, but there are no letters &#039;a&#039; !!!!!
Any ideas?

Code begin:

E:SOURCERAILSrails-2-day-3-behavior-driven-developmenttodolist&#062;rake features

(in E:/SOURCE/RAILS/rails-2-day-3-behavior-driven-development/todolist)
´??  # fetures/tsklist.feture
Feture: Tsks
In order to keep trck of tsks
People should be ble to
Crete  list of tsks
  Scenrio: List Tsks                         # fetures/tsklist.feture:7
    Given tht I hve creted  tsk &quot;tsk 1&quot;  # fetures/tsklist.feture:8
    When I go to the tsks pge                # fetures/step_definitions/webrt_st
eps.rb:6
    Then I should see &quot;tsk 1&quot;                 # fetures/step_definitions/webrt_s
teps.rb:89


1 scenrio
2 steps skipped
1 step pending (1 with no step definition)

You cn use these snippets to implement pending steps which hve no step definitio
n:

Given /^tht I hve creted  tsk &quot;tsk 1&quot;$/ do
end

					<description><![CDATA[Great tutorial. However, webrat has gotten ahead of you, I think. With webrat 1.12, it generated a 

#When /^I go to (.+)$/ do &#124;page_name&#124;
#  visit path_to(page_name)
#end

which I just commented out to finish the tutorial. Properly, I suspect I should have worked out path_to, but I was focused on making the tutorial work...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great tutorial. I have been really struggling to find this type of step by step guide that is both up to date and covers BDD.  Thanks very much.

Two minor things:  When I did the rake db:migrate only the development database was migrated and the tests are run on production by default.  Once I changed RAILS_ENV and ran the migration again all worked.

Second: I think the webrat dependency problem has been sorted out.  I just used the gem install version and the example worked OK.]]></description>
