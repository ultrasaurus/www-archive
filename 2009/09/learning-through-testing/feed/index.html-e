					<description><![CDATA[Hello Sarah,

Met you @the last Ruby Hackfest in the city. I agree that learning through tests is very valuable. One complaint I have about the AWD book is that they developed the whole Depot application and then threw in the chapter after about testing (and as I understand it was written by someone other than the core authors as an after thought). 

Learning a language by using TDD is a great way to go. Kent Beck&#039;s TDD by Example has a section where he plays with Python by creating a test framework which is similar to what you described in this article. Pretty good read I think.

All this being said, I&#039;m still trying to come to grips with TDD myself and wish there were more resources for Ruby that went from the &quot;ground up&quot; using TDD. Maybe you&#039;ll write this book Sarah ;)]]></description>
