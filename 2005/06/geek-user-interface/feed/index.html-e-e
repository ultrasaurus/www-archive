					<description><![CDATA[Everyone has a favorite stupid vi trick. You didn&#039;t ask, but I can&#039;t stand it. I have to share mine:  recorded buffers.

qa = start recording all my keystrokes in buffer a
esc (if you&#039;re in insert mode) q = stop recording my keystrokes.

Then there&#039;s the joy of having all those buffers recorded:

@a = run the keystrokes in buffer a.
32@a = run the keystrokes in @a 32 times.

I know some explanations don&#039;t travel well without demonstration (or everyone would be in love with vi -- right?) so if I explain badly, ask Scott what I&#039;m babbling about. He knows.

					<description><![CDATA[gvim is great :-)  Make sure to grab some of Adam&#039;s helpful aliases, too, like the one that will make gvim&#039;s cwd the same as the dir of the file your editing.

					<description><![CDATA[Ah, the joys of &#039;vi&#039;...

Back when I was on the C++ Standards Committee, I used a Psion handheld computer as my primary traveling machine and had a port of &#039;vi&#039; running on it that I used to edit the troff pages that generated the ISO/ANSI draft documents.

Admittedly I used the Psion word processor for taking meeting notes (I was secretary of J16 for three years)...

I&#039;ll be interested to read how you get on with Eclipse. I use it for all my day-to-day coding these days. It has its quirks but overall it&#039;s a good, solid IDE.

					<description><![CDATA[emacs still lives on the west coast in Laszlo Studios!!  Even though most of the old guard uses vim, there&#039;s still a strong emacs contingency.  I must admit that it is beautiful to see folks editing when they&#039;re on a roll with vim.
