					<description><![CDATA[So relevant. There are increasingly so many narratives in the media, we do ourselves a disservice by acknowledging, and clinging, to a single one. In Aleppo, there are four different ones alone. Closer to home, we’re now revisiting the notion that the Iraq war was necessary, admitting the NYT may have fallen victim to external forces, doctoring news in order to drum up public support.

Being able to self-reflect, and change our minds, is so important. It begs the question, do we, as a society, need a better way of supporting multiple narratives, and a more probabilistic based definition of “the truth.” Perhaps it would allow us to better maintain alternate perspectives, and thus, update the mainline accordingly. One of my favorite video snippets on the importance of being able to change our minds: https://kimon.wistia.com/medias/1yecovxvuo
